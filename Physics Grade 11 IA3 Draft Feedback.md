Hi Noah, please see some feedback on your draft below.
## Rationale
    - The purpose of the rationale is to break down the claim and identify key aspects that you will focus your report on, resulting in a specific research question that includes the aspects that you have identified. You have presnted a lot of information that would be better placed in more of a 'background' after the research question. I would not get rid of it, but re-structure.
    - Your rationale could include:
        - Introduction of electromagnetic radiation and introduce that they can be dangerous at ionixing levels
        - AÂ discussion WIFI and QI and can include the frequencies of operation as you have
        - Result in a research question that focuses on those two items (not just mentioning the frequencies)
- Then most of what you have presented is information and theory that could sit after the research question
- Be sure to answer specifically the research question, you will need to find data/evidence that focusses on those frequencies (as that is how the research question is stated)
- You will need to analyse the quality of the evidence including the limitations
- You will need support/refute the claim
- You will need to discuss potential extensions/improvements to the investigation

  
Good luck as you finish your reports, please look at the samples given to help understand the 'structure' of the response.  
  
Thanks,  
Mr Ace
