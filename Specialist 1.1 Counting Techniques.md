## Set Theory 
### Foundational Concepts
Pretty much nothing.

### Big Ideas and concepts
#### Venn Diagrams
- Circles $\rightarrow$ Sets
- Box/Rectagle $\rightarrow$ Universal set
	- i.e Everything **under consideration**. 
- Elements *or* Cardinality (Number of elements)

### Vocab and definition
#### Set:
An unordered group of numbers or list of numbers
	- Enclosed with 'set brackets' (braces  "{}")
#### Intersection of sets:
Elements that are within A *and* within B at the same time

#### Union of two sets:
All Elements that are within A or within B

#### Complement:
Everything not in A

#### Disjoint sets:
A $\cap$ B is empty

## Examples
Consider the sets $A={0, 1, 2, 3, 4}$, $B={1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8}$, and $\mathscr{E} = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}$  

a) Represent the sets on a Venn diagram
b) with the aid of the venn diagram, determine the elements in the following sets

Consider the sets $A={1, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16}, B={4, 5, 6, 9, 10 , 11, 14}, C={2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 13, 15}, \textsection={1...18}$
