### Weird relationships
Using only trial 1 values somewhat improves


### ToDo

### Rationale
- [ ] Justify modifications and talk about them... I completely forgot to do this.
- [ ] Talk about nernst equation



#### Results
#### Outliers
- [x] Set up actual final results in excel
- [x] Graph final results in desmos
	- [x] Change latex graph to match
- [ ] Add uncertainty to graph as error bars
- [ ] Add cool table as ===APPENDIX===
#### Analysis of evidence
- [x] Use of algorithms.
- [x] Visual and graphical representation of data.
- [ ] Identification of trends, patters, and/or relationships.
- [ ] Identification of uncertainty and limitations of evidence.
- [ ] Talk about outliers.
