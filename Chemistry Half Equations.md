## General rules
The chemical equations in the table (e.g. $Li^{+} + e^-$) are called half equation
	Represent redox reactions in terms of reduction and oxidation reactions that make it up


 - $E^0$ is the potential energy of the reaction of each half equation
	 - defined under standard concentration (1mol/L) against standard hydrogen electrode with $E^0 = 0\textrm{V}$ 


- Half Equations are reversible

electrons on left hand side of half equation $\implies$ reduction of half equation as the species gains electrons
$\therefore$ 
electrons on right hand side of half equation $\implies$ oxidation of half equation as the species loses electrons

To consider which reaction will occur, use the **electrochemical series table**


### Examples

## Under Acidic Conditions
### Steps
1. Balance all elements except oxygen and hydrogen
2. Balance oxygen by adding water molecules
3. Balance hydrogen by adding hydrogen ions
4. Balance the charge by adding electrons
