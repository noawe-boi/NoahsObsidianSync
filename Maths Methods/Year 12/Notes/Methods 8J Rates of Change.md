### Foundational Concepts
#### Derivatives
$\frac{dy}{dx}$ gives instantaneous rate of change.


### Big ideas and concepts

#### What gradient tells us
- $\frac{dy}{dx}>0 \implies$ increasing function
- $\frac{dy}{dx}<0\implies$ decreasing function
- $\frac{dy}{dx}=0\implies$ function is constant

### Vocab and definitions
#### Average rate of change
For $x\epsilon [a, b]$, given by $\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$
#### Instantaneous rate of change
Instantaneous rate of change of $f$, with respect to $x$ when $x=a$ is given by $f'(a)$
#### Relative rate of growth of a function is 
$\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}$
