## To graph a y=$log_e (x)$ function

**Make whatever is in the $log$ the same as whatever the $log$ base is $\rightarrow$ they cancel out and you dont have to deal with the $log$**
Similarly to graphic power functions, let what is in the log be the base of the log (so for $log_x(y)$ let $y=x$ ), so then the log is equal to 1. Then let the inside of the log be equal to 1, so that the log is equated to 0.

## What does the graph of $y=log_e (x)$ look like?
