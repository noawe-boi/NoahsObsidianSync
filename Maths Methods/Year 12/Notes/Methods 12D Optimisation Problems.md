### Foundational Concepts
#### First derivative
- $f'(x)$ 
	gives slope
- $f'(x)=0$ 
	gives stationary points

#### Second derivative
- $f''(x)$
	can identify max/min

### Vocab and definitions
N/A

### Big ideas and concepts
#### Optimum values
Will occur at max or min depending on context

### Procedures
#### Solving optimisation problems
1. Read the question carefully
2. Determine an equation that represents the scenario
3. Take derivative
4. solve for $f'(x)=0$
5. Use $f''(x)$ to find if it's max or min
6. Substitute $x$ value(x) back into original function
7. *Write your answer in words*
