For a random sample of size $n$ from a "large" population, we have:
- $E(\hat p )=p$ (the sample will have the same mean as the population)
- $sd(\hat p) = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$


Where
- $\hat p$ is the proportion of the sample that has the attribute. 
- $p$ is the proportion of the population that has the attribute 1
