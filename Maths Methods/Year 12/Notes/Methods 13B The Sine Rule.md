### Big ideas and concepts
#### The sine rule
![[The Sine Rule]]

#### When to use the sine rule
When you have: 
- One side and two angles (any side, any angles)
or
- Two sides and a non included angle (any sides, the angle not between the two sides)

#### Ambiguous angles
Sometimes you can calculate an angle as acute, when in reality is is obtuse
in case of this consider $\theta^*=180-\theta$
