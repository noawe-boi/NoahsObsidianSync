### Foundational Concepts 
#### Standard normal PDF
![[Equation for normal distribution Probability Density Function]]
#### Probability
Probability = area under the curve
### Big ideas and concepts
Because normal destructions apply to so many scenarios, calculators have inbuild functions for them, like
- NormCD
	For determining probability
- InvNormCD
	For determining bounds 
### Vocab and definitions
Syntax:
- NormCD(Lower bound, Upper bound, s.d., mean)
- InvNormCF(area, s.d. mean)
### Examples
