### Foundational Concepts
#### Normal Distribution
[[Methods 17A The Normal Distribution]]
![[Bell curve]]
#### Mean
![[Mean or expected value]]

#### Standard Deviation
![[Standard Deviation]]

#### [[Standard Distribution]]
![[Standard Distribution]]

### Vocab and definitions
#### Standard deivation statistics
##### 1 s.d.
$\approx 68\%$ of values fall within 1 s.d. of $\mu$
##### 2 s.d.
$\approx 95\%$ of values fall within 2 s.d. of $\mu$
##### 3 s.d.
$\approx 99.7\%$ of values fall within 3 s.d. of $\mu$

### Big ideas and concepts
#### Manipulating bell curves
Any normal distribution can be manipulate to match the [[Standard Distribution]].
- We can move it so that its mean is at $0$
- We can dilate it until its height and width standard

#### Relative values
When we alter a standard deviation graph, the position of any value will remain the same (relative to $\mu$, and $\sigma$). 
	Its like when you zoom in on desmos on one axis and all the values are being stretched on that axis but they are still the same values i guess.
