### Foundational Concepts
#### The derivative function
The derivative function describers the slope of the original function or curve at specific points
- $f'(x)>0 \implies f(x)$ increasing
- $f'(x)<0 \implies f(x)$ decreasing
- $f'(x)=0 \implies f(x)$ not changing
#### Sign testing around extrema
### Vocab and definitions
#### What does the second derivative tell us about the function?
- If $f''(x) > 0$ over a range
	- Concave up
	
	- If the second derivative is positive, then the slope of the original function must be increasing

- If $f''(x)<0$ over a range 
	- Gradient is decreasing over the range 
	- Concave down
#### Point of inflection 
Point of inflection is where the sign of the second derivative changes

#### Second Derivative Tests
- If $f'(a) = 0$, $f''(a)>0$ 
	The $(a, f''(a))$ is a local minimum
- If $f'(a) = 0$, $f''(a)<0$ 
	The $(a, f''(a))$ is a local maximum
- If $f'(a) = 0$, $f''(a)=0$ 
	More investigation is required
