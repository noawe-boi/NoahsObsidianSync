### Foundational Concepts

### Big Ideas and Concepts
#### Approaching bell curve
For a sufficiently large $n$ (number of trials), Normal distributions can be used to approximate binomial distribution.

### Vocab and definitions

When using a normal distribution to approximate a binomial distribution
$\mu=np$
Since $\textrm{Var}=\textrm{Standard Deviation}^2$
$\sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)}$
### Procedures
Remember to check normality 
![[How do we know when a distribution is sufficiently large]]
Use normal distribution to approximate 
- $\mu=np$
- $\sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)}$
