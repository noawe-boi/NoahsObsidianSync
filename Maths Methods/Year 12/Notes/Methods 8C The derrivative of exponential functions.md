 ## What is the gradient of an exponential function?
Consider

The derivative of this function will be

### What is the gradient of $e^x$?
For $y=e^x$, $\frac{dy}{dx} = e^x$ 
i.e. *the derivative is the same as the original function*

### For $y=e^{f(x)}$ 
The derivative is 
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(x) \times e^{f(x)}$$
