### Joining functions when gradient is matching
#### First method (polynomials)
1. Make sure they meet at the same point
2. Take the derivative of the second function
3. Choose points you want equation to pass through
4. Substitute x value for first point that you want second value to pass throug
5. Sub in the second point that you want the second point to pass through
6. Solve for $a, b, c, d,etc.$ (When in form $(ax^3+bx^2+cx+d)$) 
7. Now you have the values required for your second function that will meet at the specified point, have the same gradient at that point, and then pass through your other 2 specified points
Should look like this:

#### Second method (for other functions like trig)
1. Find the derivative of your first function then solve for the gradient at the point of intersection
2. Write your new function without any vertical or horizontal shifting. e.g. $a\cos(b(x+c)+d)\rightarrow a\cos(bx)$
3. Graph with be disjoined from regular stuff

4. Consider the gradient of your original function. 
5. Graph the derivative function of your new function to find when (OR IF) your derivative matches that of the original function
	If required find a new-new function that includes a gradient that matches that of the original. 
6. Shift the new function using the derivative function so that the points in which a specific gradient occurs are the same. 
	Let $g_1$ = $g_2$ and solve for $c$ 

### Functions we are required to use
#### Exponential
$e^x$
#### Logarithmic 
$ln(x)$
#### Trigonometric
- $Sin$
- $Cos$
- $Tan$
#### Polynomial



### notes/todo
#### overall
- Make sure use of term "maximum" is correct
- Source vertex formula
- State final function as peice wise
- Actually calculate cost
- Include cost in reasonableness

Add back 
	\item It was considered that after the first function, a sine function could be added so that more variability in the gradient could occur, therefore causing more of a thrill. 
	\item This meant that the second turning point of the cubic had to be placed so that it would coincide with one of the lower turning points of the sine function. 

#### Questions for Mr McClintock

- Should I actually fill in the "Final functions" ahh section?? 
	- Does this even matter since I defined them earlier on??
- Is the weakness about organisation valid?
	- The organisation and labelling of functions and variables throughout the solution were inconsistent and confusing. A better naming scheme was adopted toward the end of the task, with the last function becoming $f_2(x)$, rather than an arbitrary letter. 
- Should I actually be talking about the general form of each function. 
	- **Low key should actualy say WHy a function was chosen but pretty breifly** 
- Is this appropriate:
	- \item The roller coaster required structural support, lest it defy the laws of physics or collapse. For this task, the supporting structure of roller coasters consists of equally spaced main columns priced at \$180/metre, and interconnecting bracing priced at \$20/metre$^2$
- Why choose each function??
- Is it worth it to consider the difference between a creative, human approach, rather than simply choosing a cos, then a sin function because they have the greatest change in gradient, direction, and $y$ value over time??
	- **yeah i guess put it under strengths**
