### Joining functions when gradient is matching
#### First method (polynomials)
1. Make sure they meet at the same point
2. Take the derivative of the second function
3. Choose points you want equation to pass through
4. Substitute x value for first point that you want second value to pass throug
5. Sub in the second point that you want the second point to pass through
6. Solve for $a, b, c, d,etc.$ (When in form $(ax^3+bx^2+cx+d)$) 
7. Now you have the values required for your second function that will meet at the specified point, have the same gradient at that point, and then pass through your other 2 specified points
Should look like this:

#### Second method (for other functions like trig)
1. Find the derivative of your first function then solve for the gradient at the point of intersection
2. Write your new function without any vertical or horizontal shifting. e.g. $a\cos(b(x+c)+d)\rightarrow a\cos(bx)$
3. Graph with be disjoined from regular stuff

4. Consider the gradient of your original function. 
5. Graph the derivative function of your new function to find when (OR IF) your derivative matches that of the original function
	If required find a new-new function that includes a gradient that matches that of the original. 
6. Shift the new function using the derivative function so that the points in which a specific gradient occurs are the same. 
	Let $g_1$ = $g_2$ and solve for $c$ 

### Functions we are required to use
#### Exponential
$e^x$
#### Logarithmic 
$ln(x)$
#### Trigonometric
- $Sin$
- $Cos$
- $Tan$
#### Polynomial



### notes/todo
#### overall
- Make sure use of term "maximum" is correct
- Source vertex formula
#### Modelling in desmos
- i didnt end up using the desmos project... Is this that bad of a thing??
	\item The community made desmos project "Cubic through four points" allowed for a cubic to be constructed via dragging points in the desmos UI. This allowed for the creation of a viable function through trial and error.  \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/r0slnoidco}

##### The second function:
- Is adding the linear slope a good thing or a bad thing?? does it take away from the fact that I am using a trig function??
- Is this the right way to say this??
	-  $9.5\times0.2\cos (0.2(30+c))-0.1 \Rightarrow c=-6.174775557$
