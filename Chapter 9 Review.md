1. A pulse is a singe wave while a travelling wave oscillates continuously
2. light waves are not mechanical waves because they do not travel through a medium 
3. a. The pulse will undergo a 180 degree phase change and lose some energy
	b. the pulse will not be reflected at the open end

4. refraction. the light bends as it enters and exits the denser medium
5. the water will oscillate vertically in a wave that expands horizontally in all directions. 
6. a transverse wave is carried through perpendicular vibration of its medium (no movement of matter but movement of energy) while  a longitudinal wave is carried through the physically compression and rarefaction of its medium. 
7. light waves are transverse waves; P waves are Longitudinal; S waves are transverse; the vibration of a stringed instrument is transverse; ripples in a pond are transverse; tsunami waves are transverse.

9. The frequency is 0.5hz, the amplitude is 10cm, t = 2
10. A = 5, W-L = 40cm`
