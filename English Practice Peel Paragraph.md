### Stimulus 
war a necessary evil or an unnecessary process? Respond with reference to at least one major war from human history.

#### Response

##### Point
While war certainly has caused more suffering than good on many occasions, it ultimately occurs because due to fundamental differences in the values and beliefs of individuals. If all decisions were made by truly neutral and objective parties, there wouldn't be anything to disagree over. However once we consider the biases and objectives of world leaders, there aren't many other options when it comes to getting what you want other than a conflict.

##### Evidence
Consider WW2. Germany's fate was looking dire. In the wake of their first conflict, the country was in a very poor economic state. Germany relied heavily on food imports that they could neither afford to buy or rely on, long term. The German people and government wanted economic prosperity and access to their own food, however lacked the resources to do so. 

##### Explanation
Clearly German government had an ultimatum:  Succeed as a global power by taking what you need and becoming big enough that no one can stop you, or recede into a subpar country and play catch up for an indefinite amount of time.

##### Point again
It's clear that war is in no way necessary, however the desires of man for  seemingly infinite growth and power make world peace a pipe dream.
