## Definition
The direction of an electric current produces a magnetic field that opposes the field or direction of the current that created it. 


### Direction of current in a straight conductor. 
Current can also be generated in a single wire. A wire between the poles of a horseshoe magnet will concentrate positive charge on one side, and negative charge on the other.
