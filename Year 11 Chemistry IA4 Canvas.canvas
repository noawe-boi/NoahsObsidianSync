The demand for fossil energy associated with biodiesel is\nlow, so its life cycle emissions of CO2 are, not surprisingly, much lower. Per unit of work\ndelivered by a bus engine, B100 reduces net CO2 emissions by 78.45% compared to\npetroleum diesel. B20ís life cycle CO2 emissions are 15.66% lower. Thus, replacing\npetroleum diesel with biodiesel in urban buses is an extremely effective strategy for\nreducing CO2 emissions","x":2401,"y":-2550,"width":825,"height":550,"color":"5"},
