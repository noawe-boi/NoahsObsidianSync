## Things I want to ask mr mcclintock 
### What I've done
- I figured there must be a way to mathematically prove a solution is the best for the given circumstances, not just the best that I could find by scribbling on a piece of paper.
- Found algorithm to find a shortest path (Dijkstras) and am thinking of implementing it to find an ideal path and then modifying it when intersections with mirrors/cave walls occurs. 
- Modelled cave in octave (Matlab but for brokies) 
- found a way to offset wall inwards, or buffer them, so there is space for mirrors to rotate and reflect light at different angles 
- somewhat know how to list all points in a given polygon with a certain separation (like list every point in a 0.1x0.1 grid)
- thinking of running Dijkstra on it
- Is this even worth it or am I over complicating this?
- I feel like it should be way more simple than this but I also don't feel like not being able to mathematically prove a solution is the best in given circumstances is a bad thing. 
- I.e. saying that my solution is the best because I incrementally adjusted it based on issues I found isn't very straight forward and leaves a lot of room for error.
- If there is a better way of doing this or this solution is going to be worse than doing this work by hand incrementally
