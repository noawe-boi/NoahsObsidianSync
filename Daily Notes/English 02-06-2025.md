Activities:
1. Choose one of the following characters:

They all know im innocent. They've always blamed their most despicable acts on us, even when its obvious that we're just scape goats. Not even that, it's almost as if we're just cattle to them, livestock fit for the slaughter whenever the fat farmer wants a rush. 

I might never see freedom again in the eyes of the law, but I was never truly free before either. I'd rather die standing than live kneeling to the white man. Revenge is fruitless, but I have nothing to lose and everything to prove.
