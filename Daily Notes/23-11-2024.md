- Mention splitting beam in strengths. 
- Mention considering light as coming from full entrance rather than just the entry vector is a strength. 


- Weakness is that is doesn't come out completely straight despite best efforts in the time frame


- Say something about polar form
- Justification:
	- Assumed that the effect of mirror inefficiency was greater than fall off due to distance. This impacted the solution as while compressing the light beam into a shorter path but with more mirrors would 

- Mention that mirror positions are for the surface of the mirror and while t
- Mention how mirrors are defined as vectors so *scalar product* can be found
