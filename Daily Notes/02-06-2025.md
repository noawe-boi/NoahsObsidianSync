Questions for mr sonter
- Why didnt we try $[ Cu^{2+}]=0$? 
	- Is it because the answer would depend on the mineral content of the water???
	See `Clearly $[Zn^{2+}]=[Cu^{2+}]\neq 0$, as this would either result in a division by 0, or $\ln(0)$, which are both undefined.`


#### Todo
Figure out what the theory is when it comes to ions in solution and its relationship with voltage/current. 

consider 
```latex
Figure \ref{lowingVoltage} depicts a trend observed where as trials continued, the voltage of each subsequent trial decreased slightly. Procedure was considered and it was theorized that this was due to reuse of the same electrolyte solution over multiple trials. The number of ions left on solution likely decreased as measurements were taken and depending on the duration of each trial and measurement phase, which is theorized to have resulted in lower voltage.
