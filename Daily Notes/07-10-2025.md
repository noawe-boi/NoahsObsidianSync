Physics Questions 
### Paper 1
- Q6: 
	Answer was supposed to be C. I chose B. I had the $v_x$, $v_y$ mixed up. I dunno how i even messed that up. 
- Q7:


Q27
marks for:
	- Identifies that 124I has fewer neutrons that 127I
	- Describes the role of strong nuclear force in the nucleus
	- Identifies that B- radiation is released
	- Explains that decay leads to greater stability of the nucleus
example response:
	Iodine 124 has ewer neutrons within the nucleus than iodine 127 this means that the strong nuclear force acts more strongly to bind the neutrons and protons in the nucleus. As a results the beta positive decay of iodine 124 into tellurium 124 is most likely to occur, as one of the protons in the nucleus decays into a neutron.
