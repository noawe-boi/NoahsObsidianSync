### The Four Rules for Continuity Correction

Let's say you want to find the probability involving a specific integer n (like your sample count of 212).

1. **For P(X ≥ n) — "Greater than or equal to n"**
    - You want to include the bar for n. The bar for n starts at n-0.5.
    - **Action:** Subtract 0.5. You use n - 0.5 as your lower bound.
    - Example: P(X ≥ 100) becomes P(X > 99.5)
2. **For P(X > n) — "Strictly greater than n"**
    - You want to exclude the bar for n. The next bar you care about starts at n+0.5.
    - **Action:** Add 0.5. You use n + 0.5 as your lower bound.
    - Example: P(X > 100) becomes P(X > 100.5)
3. **For P(X ≤ n) — "Less than or equal to n"**
    - You want to include the bar for n. The bar for n ends at n+0.5.
    - **Action:** Add 0.5. You use n + 0.5 as your upper bound.
    - Example (Your Case): P(X ≤ 212) becomes P(X < 212.5)
4. **For P(X < n) — "Strictly less than n"**
    - You want to exclude the bar for n. The last bar you care about ends at n-0.5.
    - **Action:** Subtract 0.5. You use n - 0.5 as your upper bound.
    - Example: P(X < 100) becomes P(X < 99.5)
