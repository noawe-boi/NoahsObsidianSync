Learning Intention: Explore how different settings shape meaning, tone, and power in the film  
Success Criteria: I can explain how setting shapes meaning, and impacts the story  
  

1. Choose two settings from the film (e.g. Molly’s hut, the bush, the town square, the police station, the gallows).
2. For each setting, describe:
    - What it looks/sounds/feels like
    - Who holds power in that space?
    - What the setting symbolizes or represents
3. Answer the following:
    - How does the setting help tell us about Molly’s life and values?
    - How does the film use natural spaces (e.g. the bush) versus man-made ones (e.g. the town) to show freedom and control?
4. Quick write: Which setting would you choose to re-use in your own story, and why?
5. Time? Choose a setting from the film, and a moment or scene, and reimagine it in a different context - e.g. City in Beijing, Beach in California. Describe the moment in this new setting and think about what may change.
