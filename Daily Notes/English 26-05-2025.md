- Create a timeline of at least 10 key events in the story (include dates/years if possible).
    
- For each turning point, write:
    
    - What happens?
        
    - Why is this moment important?
        
    - How does it change our view of Molly or the world she lives in?
        
- Challenge question (optional):
    
    > What would the story be like if we saw it in chronological order (without flashbacks)? Would it change the impact?
