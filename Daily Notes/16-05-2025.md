### Specialist
- Revise 7.2 (graphing tan part)
	Pull up joel speranza math

### Methods
- METHODS 12B EXAMPLE 9 IS ON THE EXAM 

### Physics
#### Assessment ToDo
##### General
- **Rearrange the original experiment to find the uncertainty in the angle across the whole thing.** You need something to compare against 
	![[Pasted image 20250516144847.png]]
	While the average of any individual measurement should be $\pm0.5$, when we average out the uncertainty of the measured angles assuming they are all correct we get $\pm0.1\bar{6}$
- Fix working in rationale 
- Fix "Since we now have the angle in terms of the gradient" section that I made up so that it actually means something.

##### Evaluation
- While the uncertainty in the scale was very low, experimental processes created error.
- While the angle gun was also *systematic error*, the uncertainty was much greater, therefore you would have to do more trials.
