### Specialist
- Revise 7.2 (graphing tan part)
	Pull up joel speranza math

### Methods
- METHODS 12B EXAMPLE 9 IS ON THE EXAM 

### Physics
#### Assessment todo
##### General
- Fix working in rationale 
- Fix "Since we now have the angle in terms of the gradient" section that I made up so that it actually means something.


##### Evalutaion
- While the uncertainty in the scale was very low, experimental processes created error.
- While the angle gun was also *systematic error*, the uncertanty was much greater, therefore you would have to do more trials.
