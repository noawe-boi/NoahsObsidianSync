Activities:

- Fill out a **character map** for the following four characters:
    
    - Molly Johnson
        
    - Yadaka
        
    - Nate Clintoff
        
    - Danny Johnson
        
    
    For each, answer:
    
    - What does this character want?  
        What does this character fear or try to avoid?
        
    - What values or themes does this character represent in the story?  
        How does this character change throughout the film?
        
    - What does this character's voice or perspective add to the story?
        
- Choose **two characters** and complete:
    
    - How do they change over the course of the story?
        
    - What values or themes do they reveal?
        
- Short written reflection (5–7 sentences):
    
    > Whose voice did you connect with most, and why?  
    > How might you draw inspiration from that character in your own writing?
    

4. Choose one character and reimagine them in a different way - think about ways you can change them up whilst still remaining true to the character - e.g. gender, age, occupation, culture, ethnicity. Write a paragraph describing the character
