#### Reliability
Consider the estiamted $E_{AF}$ and $P_{OF}$ figures for each reactor size. Create plot. comment on plot. talk about how reliability gets worse as size increases. compare reliability to solar


#### Scalability
- Mention which has better reliability at scale
Maybe actually research what is important when scalability is being considered. 
	- Talk about required resources
	- Talk about waste products (waste scales with size of infrastructure)
