### Chem I didnt understand

In the context of your experiment with the four unknown metals and their reactions with 1M metal nitrate solutions, here's how to interpret the results:

1. **Coating on the metal**: If a coating forms on the metal (e.g., metal A when placed in B(NO₃)₂ solution), this indicates that a displacement reaction has occurred. This means that metal A is more reactive than metal B, allowing A to displace B from its compound (the nitrate solution). In this case, metal A would likely be more electropositive than metal B in the reactivity series of metals.
    
2. **No reaction**: If there is no reaction observed (no coating or change in appearance), this indicates that metal A is less reactive than metal B. In this scenario, metal A cannot displace metal B from the solution, meaning that A is less electropositive or of similar reactivity to B.
    

Overall, you can use these observations to deduce the relative reactivity of the unknown metals based on their interactions with the nitrate solutions.
