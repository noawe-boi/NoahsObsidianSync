### What is it?
Half life the time it takes for a mass of radioactive substance to decay so that it is half its original weight.
$$N(t) = N_0 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{t}{t_{\frac{1}{2}}}}$$
Where
- $t$ is time
- $t_{\frac{1}{2}}$ is half life
- $N_0$ is the starting mass
- $N$ is the mass
#### When is there none left?
There is usually not a detectable amount after 6 half life's
