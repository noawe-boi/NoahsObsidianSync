Pipe with open end will form anti node if a standing wave is formed


### Pipes with 2 open ends 

#### Fundamental Harmonic
L = (1/2) x Lambda
![[Open Pipe Fundamental Harmonic]]

#### Second Harmonic
L = Lambda

![[Open Ends Second Harmonic]]

##### Third Harmonic 
L = (3/2) x Lambda
![[Open Ends Third Harmonic]]

#### The relationship between Length of the pipe and wavelength
- L = (N x Lambda) / 2
- f = (N x V) / (2 x L)




### Pipes with one closed and and one open end 

##### Fundamental Harmonic
L = (1/4) x Lambda
![[Pipe with close end Fundamental Harmonic]]

##### Third Harmonic
L = (3/4) x Lambda 
![[Pipe with close end Third Harmonic]]
#### The Relationship between pipe length and wavelength 
 - L = (N x Lambda) / 4
 Where 
 - N = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc
Might be written as 
- L = ((2n-1) x Lambda ) / 4)
