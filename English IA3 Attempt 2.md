The weight on his shoulders was greater than that of any physical weight he could have described. The beat of the sun on his back like a blanket of hot coals that seemed to weigh him down and made his mouth dryer than the grass he walked on. Nana had always liked things when they stayed the same. Her words now echoed through his mind. "Jeshua, why do you think us elders know best? It's because all the others who thought they knew better went off on their own and never came back." He loved her. Couldn't help but think back then that they ought to come back some say and share what they learned during their travels. Now he realized that they probably ended up in the same situation as him

'Not like I had a choice though', he thought to himself, kicking up some dust from the ground in his frustration. The air around him became hazy, reminding him of why he ran away. His Nana's eyes, once as clear as the night sky, too became hazy. The old ways, the whispers of the ancestors, offered no cure to her ailment.
