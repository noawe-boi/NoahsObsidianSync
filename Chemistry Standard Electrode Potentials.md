## What are standard Electrode Potentials?
Consider the series

These half equations and their strengths are measured by connecting them to a hydrogen half cell.
This allows the **standard electrode potentials $(E_0)$** to be measured against the hydrogen cell. 


## Potential Difference

### EMF
The voltage generated by the cell is known as the **cell potential difference** or *EMF*

Just consider it the voltage of the battery

### $E_0$ values
In any spontaneous reaction, the potential difference of the cell can be quantified as:
$E^0_{  \;\textrm{cell}} = E^0 _\textrm{reduction half equation} = E^0 _{\textrm{oxidation half equation}}$  

Knowing cell potential lets you predict spontaneity and compare cells

## Limitations
The standard electrode potentials are only accurate under standard conditions
i.e. 
- Concentration of each species is $1M$
- Temperature is $298K$ or $25^\circ C$   
- Solids are pure
- The pressure is $100Kpa$ or $1 \; \textrm{atmopsphere}$
