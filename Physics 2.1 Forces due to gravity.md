## The four fundamental forces
### Gravitational
### Electromagnetic
### Weak Nuclear Forces
### Strong Nuclear Forces


## Weight and mass
### Weight
#### What is it?
- A measure of the force of gravity acting on an object
#### Measured in:
- Newtons ($N$)
### Mass
#### What is it?
- A measure of an objects resistance to change in motion
#### Measured in:
- Kilograms ($kg$)
- Grams ($g$)
### Converting mass to weight 
- On earth, $g=9.8 N/kg$
$\therefore 1kg = (1\times 9.8)N = 9.8N$


### Normal/Reaction Force
- The force from a surface 'reacting' to the weight of an object in the opposite direction to gravity and other applied forces
- "Equal and opposite"
	- Equal in the total force applied
	- In opposite direction
i.e $F_N=F_g$

##### NOTE: 
The forces between stacked objects are not always equal to the force between the gravity on top and the object supporting the second. An Example of this is when the supporting object is sloped.
#### Describing normal forces
- $F_{AB} \implies$ Force on A due to B
