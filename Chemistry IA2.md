### Rationale





## a considered rationale for the experiment
#### Introduction

Understanding changes in enthalpy $(\Delta H)$ is crucial when interpreting the changes that occur through chemical reactions. This experiment aims to further investigate the change in enthalpy when varying amounts of magnesium carbonate ($MgCO_3$) react with a constant volume of hydrochloric acid ($HCl$) by modifying a previous experiment. 


#### Background
Compounds store energy in the bonds of their components. This bond energy is a component of the compound's enthalpy, or sum of its total energy. 
When Chemical reactions occur, the energy contained in the product(s) often do not contain or sum the same amount of energy as its reactant(s). Since energy cannot be created or destroyed, this difference in energy is either absorbed from or released into the environment in the form of heat. 

This change in total energy, or enthalpy $(\Delta H)$, can be measured by measuring the change in temperature or a substance with a known specific heat, then substituting all known values into the equation $q=mc\Delta T$, where:
- $q$ is the amount of energy absorbed or released in order for the change in temperature to occur
- $m$ is the mass of the sample
- $c$ is the specific heat of the sample
- $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature 


#### Assumptions
It is assumed that the specific heat capacity of the reaction mixture is the same as water. This is because 2M $HCl$ is mostly water. 
Another assumption is that the calorimeter used is perfect and does not lose any heat over the course of the reaction. If this were not assumed then the slight loss of heat would have to be accounted for. 
While it would be ideal for the reaction to go all the way to completion over the course of the minute that stirring occurred, this cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, it must be assumed that the reaction goes to competition.

| Independent variables   | Dependent variables         | Assumed Constant Variables |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| Weight of $MgCO_3$ used | $\Delta T$ after one minute | Air Pressure               |
|                         |                             | Volume of $HCl$            |
|                         |                             | Concentration of $HCl$     |
|                         |                             | Length of trials           |

##### Justification
The results of the original experiment fell short of 
It was hypothesized that the calorimeter used did not sufficiently insulate the reaction mixture, which lead to loss of heat over the course of the experiment and an overall lower $\Delta H$ value than what was predicted.

Additionally, the amount of $MgCO_3$ was varied across multiple trials. The aim of this was to find the relationship between the amount added and the $\Delta H$ value more accurately.

Considering 50ml of 2M HCL was used, there is $2mol/L*0.05L=0.1$ moles of HCL in the solution. 
Considering a maximum of 3.5g $MgCO3$ used, there is $\frac{3.5g}{84.3g/mol}\approx 0.04$ moles of $MgCO_3$

Considering the reaction taking place: $MgCO_3​(s)+2HCl(aq)→MgCl_2​(aq)+H_2​O(l)+CO_2​(g)$, the number of moles of $MgCO_3$ is smaller than the number of moles of $HCl$. This means that $MgCO_3$ will be the limiting reactant in this reaction.

#### Methodology
1. Weigh desired amount of $MgCO_3$ using digital scale and place inside of calorimeter

1. Add 50 mL of 2.0 M $HCl$ to calorimeter and record the temperature until it remains stable for 2 minutes. Record this as the initial temperature.

2. Accurately weigh desired amount of $MgCO_3$, using an electronic balance and weigh boat.

3. Add the $MgCO_3$ to the $HCl$ in the calorimeter and stir constantly for one minute, then record the maximum temperature that the solution reaches in the calorimeter in the data table.

4.  Repeat for remaining quantities of $MgCO_3$ in 0.5g increments.

## Research Question
Considering these modifications, the research question for this experiment is:

"What is the effect of varying metal oxide ($MgCO3$) quantities on the temperature change and overall enthalpy when combined with a volume of 50ml, 2M, hydrochloric acid ($HCl$)?"

#### Processing of data

Raw data was processed to find the $\Delta H$ value for each trial based on the change in temperature using the formula $q=mc\Delta C$, 
where $q$ is the change in enthalpy, or $\Delta H$, $m$ is the mass of 2M $HCl$ used in each trial, $c$ is the specific heat of the medium being heated, this was approximated as water, and $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature in $C\degree$. 
The accepted value for the change in enthalpy of the reaction $MgCO_3​(s)+2HCl(aq)→MgCl_2​(aq)+H_2​O(l)+CO_2​(g)$ is -24.01 kJ/mol (https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/Oregon_Tech_PortlandMetro_Campus/OT_-_PDX_-_Metro%3A_General_Chemistry_I/08%3A_Thermochemistry/8.04%3A_Standard_Enthalpy_and_Hess_Law). 

Raw data was brought into Excel and values for Absolute Error and % Error were found. In addition to this, the raw data was graphed so that the relationship between $\Delta H$ and Mass of $MgCO_3$ could be found.

<div style="color:grey">Figure 6: Graph demonstraing relationship between Mass of MgCO3 and Change in Temperature</div> 


During this process, it was found that as the mass of $MgCO_3$ added reached 3 grams, the increase in temperature stopped increasing. To linearise the graph, these values were removed and the intercept of the graph was manually set to 0.

#### Analysis of trends/patterns
It was found that as the mass of $MgCO_3$ added doubled from 1g to 2g, the average $\Delta T$ almost exactly doubles from 12.33 to 24.67. This suggests a highly linear relationship between these two variables. 
However, as the mass of $MgCO_3$ increases to and past 3g, the relationship resembles as asymptote at roughly $\Delta T=30$ as seen in *Figure 7*. This should indicate that $HCl$ is a limiting reactant, however, previous calculations established that this should not be true.
Once these values were removed, the relationship becomes highly linear as can be observed in *Figure 8*.

| Limited time   | It was observed that masses of $MgCO_3$ higher or equal than 3g did not increase the $\Delta T$. This was could not have been caused by $HCl$ being a limiting reactant, but could have instead been the consequence of the primitive stirring setup used and the relativley short period of time stirring occured. | It is suggested that an automatic stirring device is used in future to more reliably and effectively |
