### Rationale





## a considered rationale for the experiment
#### Introduction

Understanding changes in enthalpy $(\Delta H)$ is crucial when interpreting the changes that occur through chemical reactions. This experiment aims to further investigate the change in enthalpy when varying amounts of magnesium carbonate ($MgCO_3$) react with a constant volume of hydrochloric acid ($HCL$) by modifying a previous experiment. 


#### Background
Compounds store energy in the bonds of their components. This bond energy is a component of the compound's enthalpy, or sum of its total energy. 
When Chemical reactions occur, the energy contained in the product(s) often do not contain or sum the same amount of energy as its reactant(s). Since energy cannot be created or destroyed, this difference in energy is either absorbed from or released into the environment in the form of heat. 

For example, when $MgCO_3$ reacts with $HCL$, they react to form $MgCL_2$, $H_2O$ and $CO_2$. The equation of this reaction is:

$MgCO_3​(s)+2HCl(aq)→MgCl_2​(aq)+H_2​O(l)+CO_2​(g)$.

### INSERT SECTION ABOUT HOW TO FIND ESTIMATED $\Delta H$ 
*something to do with summing $\Delta H$ values of each product*

This change in total energy, or enthalpy $(\Delta H)$, can be measured by measuring the change in temperature or a substance with a known specific heat, then substituting all known values into the equation $q=mc\Delta T$, where:
- $q$ is the amount of energy absorbed or released in order for the change in temperature to occur
- $m$ is the mass of the sample
- $c$ is the specific heat of the sample
- $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature 



What happens when reaction occurs

*talk about molar ammount*
for this reason the maximum amount of $MgCO_3$ was limited to 3.5g

#### Justified Modifications (table)
## Justified modifications to the methodology
#### Original Experiment

##### Changes to methodology
The original experiment aimed to quantify the $\Delta H$ value when varying amounts of $MgCO_3$ were added to 50ml of 2 mol $HCL$. The largest modification was the quality of equipment used to measure $\Delta H$. The original experiment used a calorimeter made from Styrofoam cups and a plastic petri-dish. 

##### Justification
The results of the original experiment fell short of 
It was hypothesized that the calorimeter used did not sufficiently insulate the reaction mixture, which lead to loss of heat over the course of the experiment and an overall lower $\Delta H$ value than what was predicted.

Additionally, the amount of $MgCl_3$ was varied across multiple trials. The aim of this was to find the relationship between the amount added and the $\Delta H$ value more accurately.

#### Methodology

1. Add 50 mL of 2.0 M $HCl$ to the calorimeter and record the temperature until it remains stable for 2 minutes. Record this as the initial temperature.

2. Accurately weigh desired amount of $MgCO_3$, using an electronic balance and weigh boat.

3. Add the $MgCO_3$ to the $HCl$ in the calorimeter and stir constantly for one minute, then record the maximum temperature that the solution reaches in the calorimeter in the data table.

4.  Repeat for all quantities of $MgCO_3$ in 0.5g increments.

#### Research Question
Considering these modifications, the research question for this experiment is:

"What is the effect of varying metal oxide ($MgCO3$) quantities on the temperature change and overall enthalpy when combined with a volume of 50ml, 2 molar, hydrochloric acid ($HCL$)?"

#### Processing of data
Raw data was processed to find the $\Delta H$ value for each trial based on the change in temperature using the formula

$q=mc\Delta C$ 

Where $q$ is the change in enthalpy, or $\Delta H$, $m$ is the mass of 2 molar $HCL$ used in each trial, $c$ is the specific heat of the medium being heated, this was approximated as water, and $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature in $C\degree$. 

Raw data was brought into Excel and values for Absolute Error, % Error, total % Error,
