### Rationale

apply understanding of chemical equilibrium systems or oxidation and reduction to modify experimental methodologies and process primary data

Investigate phenomena associated with chemical equilibrium systems or oxidation and reduction through an experiment





## a considered rationale for the experiment
#### Introduction
Understanding changes in enthalpy $(\Delta H)$ is crucial when understanding the changes that occur through chemical reactions. This experiment aims to further investigate the change in enthalpy when varying amounts of magnesium carbonate ($MgCO_3$) react with a constant volume of hydrochloric acid ($HCL$) by modifying a previous experiment. 

#### Background
Compounds store energy in the bonds of their components. This bond energy is a component of the compound's enthalpy, or sum of its total energy. 
When Chemical reactions occur, the energy contained in the product(s) often do not contain or sum the same amount of energy as its reactant(s). Since energy cannot be created or destroyed, this difference in energy is either absorbed from or released into the environment in the form of heat. 
This change in total energy, or enthalpy $(\Delta H)$, can be measuring by measuring the change in temperature or a substance with a known specific heat.  

## Justified modifications to the methodology
#### Original Experiment

##### Changes to methodology
The original experiment aimed to quantify the $\Delta H$ value when varying amounts of $MgCl_2$ were added to 50ml of 2 mol $HCL$. The largest modification was the quality of equipment used to measure $\Delta H$. The original experiment used a calorimeter made from Styrofoam cups and a plastic petri dish. 

##### Justification
The results of the original experiment fell short of 
It was hypothesized that the calorimeter used did not sufficiently insulate the reaction mixture, which lead to loss of heat over the course of the experiment and an overall lower $\Delta H$ value than what was predicted.

Additionally, the amount of $MgCl_3$ was varied across multiple trials. The aim of this was to find the relationship between the amount added and the $\Delta H$ value more accurately.

#### Research Question
what is the effect of varying metal oxide (MgCO3) quantities on the temperature change and overall enthalpy when combined with a volume of 50ml, 2 molar, hydrochloric acid (HCL)?

## Results


#### Raw Data

#### Processing of data
Raw data was processed to find the $\Delta H$ value for each trial based on the change in temperature using the formula

$q=mc\Delta C$ 

Where $q$ is the change in enthalpy, or $\Delta H$, $m$ is the mass of 2 molar $HCL$ used in each trial, $c$ is the specific heat of the medium being heated, this was approximated as water, and $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature in $C\degree$. 

Raw data was brought into excel and values for Absolute Error, % Error, total % Error,
