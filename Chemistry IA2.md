### Introduction
Understanding changes in enthalpy $(\Delta H)$ is crucial when understanding the changes that occur through chemical reactions. This experiment aims to further investigate the change in enthalpy when varying amounts of magnesium carbonate ($MgCO_3$) react with a constant volume of hydrochloric acid ($HCL$) by modifying a previous experiment. 

#### Background

gCO3​(s)+2HCl(aq)→MgCl2​(aq)+H2​O(l)+CO2​(g)
