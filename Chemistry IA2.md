### Introduction
Understanding changes in enthalpy $(\Delta H)$ is crucial when understanding the changes that occur through chemical reactions. This experiment aims to investigate the change in enthalpy when varying amounts of magnesium carbonate ($MgCO_3$) react with a constant volume of hydrochloric acid ($HCL$)
