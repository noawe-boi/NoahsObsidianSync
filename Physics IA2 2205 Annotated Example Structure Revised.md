#### **Report Title**
*   Keep it **clear and relevant** to your experiment.

#### **Research Question**
*   What **exact relationship** are you testing between your changed thing and measured thing?
*   Make it **specific and relevant** to your experiment.

#### **Rationale**
*   **Why** are you doing this experiment? What's the purpose and reasons?
*   Briefly mention the **original experiment** and what it did.
*   **Explain the physics ideas/background scientific information** behind your experiment.
*   **Why did you change** the original experiment (refine, extend, or redirect)?
*   How does this modification help you test your question?
*   Link back to your **Research Question**.

#### **Method**
*   Briefly describe the **original method**.
*   List **exactly what you changed** (the Modifications). Justify these changes.
*   Explain **how you handled risks** in the experiment (Management of Risk).
*   Make sure your method allowed you to collect **sufficient and relevant data**.

#### **Results**
*   Show your **Raw Data** clearly (like in a table). Collect **sufficient and relevant** data.
*   Show **Calculations** you did to process the data (like averages, uncertainty). Use **appropriate algorithms, visual and graphical representations**. Show **how you calculated uncertainty** (absolute or percentage? Use absolute for graph errors).
*   Show your **Graphs**. Make sure they follow **scientific conventions** (labels, units, error bars).

#### **Analysis of Evidence**
*   **Look at your processed data and graphs**.
*   **What patterns, trends, or relationships** do you see? Describe them clearly.
*   Talk about the **uncertainty** in your data and **what limits** your evidence.

#### **Interpretation and Conclusion**
*   **What is the answer to your Research Question** based on your data? This should be a **justified conclusion linked to the research question**.
*   Explain **what your results mean**, considering the patterns and uncertainty you found.
*   Compare your results to the **physics theory** you mentioned in the Rationale.
*   Briefly state if your conclusion is **reliable** and **valid** (you'll explain more below).

#### **Evaluation of Experimental Process & Suggestions**
*   **How good was your experiment?** Was the experimental process **reliable** (consistent) and **valid** (measured what it should)? Provide a **justified discussion**.
*   Talk about the **errors** and **limitations** you found (random and systematic, controlled variables, assumptions) and **how they affected your results and conclusion**.
*   Suggest **specific ways to improve** the experiment based on the errors/limitations you found. These should be **logically derived from the analysis and evaluation**.
*   Suggest **ideas for other experiments** related to this one (extensions).

#### **Reference List**
*   List **all sources** you used (like websites, books, etc.).
*   Use **appropriate referencing conventions**.
*   Make sure you **acknowledge sources** throughout your report when you use their information (in-text citations).

**General things:**
*   Present it like a **scientific report**. Use **appropriate genre conventions**.
*   Use **scientific language**.
*   Aim for about **1500-2000 words**.
