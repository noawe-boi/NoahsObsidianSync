- possible end to the life cycle of a fast burning star
- it forms from the contraction of a Neutron [[Star]]
- part of [[Life Cycle of Stars]] ([[Life Cycle Of Stars Diagram.excalidraw]])


### How its formed:
- If the mass of the neutron star is more than 3 times the mass of our sun it can pull mass into its center tightly enough to form a black hole
- the neutron star disappears and stops pulsating as radio waves cannot escape the pull
- the black hole cannot be seen as the gravitational field pulls in light.
