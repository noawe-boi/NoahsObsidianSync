## Motion of objects launched at angles
The motion of an object at a parabola is a function of time
$$s_y=u_yt+\frac{1}{2}at^2$$ $$s=vt-\frac{1}{2}at^2$$ Where:
- $s=\textrm{displacement}$
- $v=\textrm{final velocity}$
- $a=\textrm{acceleration}$
- $t =\textrm{time}$

### Landing at the same height as at launch
If this occurs,
- $\textrm{impact speed} = \textrm{launch speed}$
- $\textrm{impact velocity} = -\textrm{launch velocity}$
-  $\textrm{vertical displacement}$ = 0


#### Worked Example
##### WORKED EXAMPLE 1.3A
![[Physics WORKED EXAMPLE 1.3A]]


### Landing at a lower height than at launch
If this occurs:
- Vertical displacement at impact is no longer zero. Is some negative quantity

### Landing at higher point than launch height
If this occurs:
- Vertical displacement at impact is no longer zero. Is some positive quantity.
