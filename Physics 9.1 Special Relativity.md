### Muon decay (yap)
#### Wtf is a muon?
A tiny subatomic particle formed by cosmic rays colliding with oxygen and nitrogen. They have an extremely short lifespan of $\approx 2.2$ microseconds and travel at $>0.99c$.
This short lifespan means that despite their speed, *they* **should** *never hit the earths surface.*
However **special relativity** proves this wrong, as it was proven that objects travelling close to the speed of light experience time differently. 


### Time dilation and length contraction
#### Time dilation
Time 'stretching' out and becoming bigger

#### Length contraction

### Frames of reference. 
#### What are frames of reference?
The set of axes that position or motion is described as relative to.

#### Inertial vs non inertial frames of reference
##### Inertial 
A frame of reference that is stationary or moving at a constant velocity.
##### Non inertial
A frame of reference that is accelerating or decelerating.
### Postulates (assumptions) of special relativity
#### 1. 
The laws of physics are the same in all inertial (uniformly moving) frames of reference.
	This implies that the rules are different in a non inertial (non uniformly moving) frame of reference.
#### 2. 
The speed of light in a vacuum as the same value, $c$, in all inertial (uniformly moving) frames of reference.
