The probability of an event occurring can be related to whether or not another event has occured
e.g) drawing a card from a deck removes a card from the deck. Therefore the probability of drawing the next card will be alterred
$$
Pr(A|B) \textrm{(Probability of A given B has occured)}=\frac{Pr(A\cap B)}{Pr(B)}
$$
