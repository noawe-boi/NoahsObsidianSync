### Describe characteristics of product's environment

The music industry is ever evolving and, ever since their creation, synthesizers and digital audio processing tools have been a major component in nearly every song. Because of this, the music industry has grown with and been heavily influenced by new and emerging technologies that expand what is possible in the space and give artists enhanced means to express their ideas (de-Miguel-Molina & Santamarina-Campos, 2021). The advent of new technology also allows means to create and manufacture these new applications of emerging technologies that are accessible to hobbyists and start-ups.
The global music production equipment market size is predicted to grow by 4.95%, which amounts to roughly 2.39 billion USD, between 2023 and 2028 (www.technavio.com, 2024).
Furthermore, it's predicted that the global market for synthesizers is estimated to grow by 2.7%, an increase of 265.44 million USD, from 2023 to the end of 2030 (Global Industry Analysts, Inc., 2024). 


### Business situation
PA is currently in the seed stage and faces many of the typical challenges that businesses in the seed stage face. While PA has secured over $242,000 AUD in funding through its Kickstarter, this is not a guarantee of short nor long term growth and currently not a guarantee that the final version of their product will launch.
PA list 2 risks and challenges they may face specifically on their Kickstarter. These challenges are supply chain issues and knock-off/clone devices. The supply chain for a device like the HiChord is very complex due to the variety, quantity and specifications of its  electronic components. The majority, if not all, of its electronic components could be susceptible to shortage or price increase in the coming years (Seeley, 2021).
The second risk listed, clone devices, is also significant. Clone devices are usually worse quality than the originals but are designed to be similar or indistinguishable in appearance to the original product. These devices not only shift sales away from the original manufacturer, but can damage the reputation of their product or brand due to the often low quality of these fakes.

- Many desktop computers can already replicate or emulate the features of the HiChord without the need of additional hardware. Do 



#### Economic 
- Price: Competitor teenage engineering charges thousands for similar products. Current Kickstarter price for HiChord is only $374 AUD.

#### Political
- RoHS: RoHS, or Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment, is a set of regulations that must be followed by all electronics manufacturers in the EU in order for their product to be legally sold in certain region. HiChord must not include any hazardous substances, such as leaded solder, throughout its manufacturing in order to remain compliant.
- Trade Policies: International trade policies may limit, tariff or even prevent the import and export of electronic devices, including synthesizers like the HiChord





### SWOT
(in a table)

remember to actually analyze and interpret it instead of just doing a brain dead list

#### Strengths 
Low barrier of entry
Rich Feature set:
Portability: 
Novelty


#### Weaknesses
Simplicity: Due to the low complexity of the device, mor advanced users may be unsatisfied with the limitations this causes. 
Price: Many consumers may not be able to justify the high price point for a product 'that could just be an app'.


#### Opportunities
Niche Market: Success within its Niche would come with strong support both in attention and financially in the form of sales. Enough attention and it will break out of its niche. 
Integration potential future products or ecosystems: allowing future or existing products from PA or other brands to work in conjunction with the HiChord. 

#### Threats
Competitors: 'Teenage engineering' (TA) makes similar products that are considered to be of higher quality that provide similar functionality and more premium features. 



### Analysis and synthesis

The music industry is known for its early adoption when it comes to new and novel technology, especially in the hobbyist and home studio space and the growth projections indicate a healthy market environment that has the ability to support new competitors. While AI could be a threat to the wider music industry, PA occupies a niche within it that is drawn to products because of their novelty, not necessarily their practicality nor feature set.  While the price of the HiChord is far from inexpensive, it positions it competitively against other premium product which can cost thousands. This lower price point could attract hobbyists and home studio owners and expand the consumer base for the HiChord. Compliance the EU regulations such as RoHS is essential if the HiChord is to enter the region and international trade policies may disrupt the import or export of HiChord's, or the components needed to create them. While compliance with RoHS and similar regulations is objective and straightforward, Trade restrictions and laws are unpredictable and thus must continue to be monitored and considered a risk. 

The low barrier of entry and portability are the main features of the HiChord and set it apart from its competitors and allows users with little to no knowledge in music theory to create unique sounds. Its novelty and ease of use make it likely to appeal to a broad audience outside of the niche of just professional or home studio producers. Its possibility for use both at home and outside adds value and distinguishes it from MIDI keyboards with similar features. Furthermore it allows it to be used in group settings and could make it somewhat of a social device or status symbol.

 The devices low complexity and simple nature may not appeal to users seeking more sophisticated production tools. Additionally, many of its features already exist as plugins or software for popular Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) software.

Competitors such as TA, known for their similar music production 



Stop clones by building brand loyalty

By putting emphasis on the advantages of hardware synthesizers and the unique tactile experience of operating the Hi chord 

integrate AI into its products to assist instead of completely taking over the music production process.
