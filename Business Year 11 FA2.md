### Describe characteristics of product's environment

The music industry is ever evolving and, ever since their creation, synthesizers and digital audio processing tools have been a major component in nearly every song. Because of this, the music industry has grown with and been heavily influenced by new and emerging technologies that expand what is possible in the space and give artists enhanced means to express their ideas (de-Miguel-Molina & Santamarina-Campos, 2021). The advent of new technology also allows means to create and manufacture these new applications of emerging technologies that are accessible to hobbyists and start-ups.
The global music production equipment market size is predicted to grow by 4.95%, which amounts to roughly 2.39 billion USD, between 2023 and 2028 (www.technavio.com, 2024).
Furthermore, it's predicted that the global market for synthesizers is estimated to grow by 2.7%, an increase of 265.44 million USD, from 2023 to the end of 2030 (Global Industry Analysts, Inc., 2024). 


### Business situation
PA is currently in the seed stage and faces many of the typical challenges that businesses in the seed stage face. While PA has secured over $242,000 AUD in funding through its Kickstarter, this is not a guarantee of short nor long term growth and currently not a guarantee that the final version of their product will launch.
PA list 2 risks and challenges they may face specifically on their Kickstarter. These challenges are supply chain issues and knock-off/clone devices. The supply chain for a device like the HiChord is very complex due to the variety, quantity and specifications of its  electronic components. The majority, if not all, of its electronic components could be susceptible to shortage or price increase in the coming years (Seeley, 2021).
The second risk listed, clone devices, is also significant. Clone devices are usually worse quality than the originals but are designed to be similar or indistinguishable in appearance to the original product. These devices not only shift sales away from the original manufacturer, but can damage the reputation of their product or brand due to the often low quality of these fakes.

## Analysis

### PEST


#### Socio cultural 
- Interest in accessible, user-friendly and portable music production and playback devices predicted to be the fastest growing consumer industries by 2030.

#### Economic 
- Price: Competitor teenage engineering charges thousands for similar products. Current Kickstarter price for HiChord is only $374 AUD

#### Political
- RoHS: RoHS, or Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment, is a set of regulations that must be followed by all electronics manufacturers in the EU in order for their product to be legally sold in certain region. HiChord must not include any hazardous substances, such as leaded solder, throughout its manufacturing in order to remain compliant.





### SWOT
(in a table)

remember to actually analyze and interpret it instead of just doing a brain dead list

#### Strengths 
Low barrier of entry: Allows people without knowledge in music theory to create music. 
Rich Feature set: hardware supports up to 10 Oscillators and comes with a variety of effects. This is leagues ahead of competitors considering its size. 
Portability: Its possibility for use both at home and outside adds value and distinguishes it from MIDI keyboards with similar features. Furthermore it allows it to be used in group settings and could make it somewhat of a social device or status symbol. 
Novelty: There are very few other products with the same feature set that are as user friendly as the pocket operator. It is simple enough that a baby could use it


#### Weaknesses
Simplicity: Due to the low complexity of the device, mor advanced users may be unsatisfied with the limitations this causes. 
Price: Many consumers may not be able to justify the high price point for a product 'that could just be an app'.


#### Opportunities
Niche Market: Success within its Niche would come with strong support both in attention and financially in the form of sales. Enough attention and it will break out of its niche. 
Integration potential future products or ecosystems: allowing future or existing products from PA or other brands to work in conjunction with the HiChord. 

#### Threats
Competitors: 'Teenage engineering' (TA) makes similar products that are considered to be of higher quality that provide similar functionality and more premium features.
