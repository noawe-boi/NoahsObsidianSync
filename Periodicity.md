## Definition
The trends we see across the periodic table

## What can be found using periodicity?

### State of matter at room temperature
#### Trend
- Across a period, to the right, elements generally more from a solid to a gaseous state
#### Why?
 - Due to types of bonds and structures formed by elements (strong, (solid) lattice structures or weak structres that are easily broken and cause a state change to either a liquid or a gas)

### [[Core charge]]
#### Trend
![[Core charge]]



### Atomic radii
#### Trend
- **right across period $\rightarrow$ smaller atomic radii**
- *down group $\rightarrow$ bigger atomic radii*
#### Why?
- **Core charge increases, electron shells the same**
	- **Valence electrons more attracted to nucleus**

- *Core charge constant, number of electrons shells increasing
	- *Valence electrons less attracted to nucleus*


### Electronic configuration


### First [[Ionisation Energy]] and [[Electronegativity]]


### Reactivity with water
