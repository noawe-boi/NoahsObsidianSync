## Foundational Concepts
### Definite integral 
Gives area under grapp
$\int^b_{a} f(x)dx=F(b)-f(a)$

## Big ideas and concepts
'Positive' and 'Negative' areas can cancel each other out. 
$\int^b_{a} f(x)dx=F(b)-f(a)$
$\therefore$$\int^a_{b} f(x)dx=F(a)-f(b)$
$=(f(b)-f(a))$
$=-\int_{b}^a f(x)dx$

## Vocab and Definitions
### Signed Area
- Includes a $+$ or $-$ sign
- Sections can 'cancel' each other out
- Can just evaluate $\int_{b}^af(x)dx$
$\int 10/$
### Unsigned area
- Each section is considered to have a positive area
- Have to split negative and positive sections
- 

## Procedures
- Identify x intercepts
- take definite integral for each sections
- Add areas
