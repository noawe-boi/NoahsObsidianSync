Therefore very few muons would travel the full 10km to be detected on the surface of the earth. However most muons do not decay before reaching teh surface of the each and are detected. Given their short half life, the distance that muons are observed to travel is much greater than what is expensed by newtonian physics and can be better explained using special relativity. The muons are travelling at relativistic speeds and therefore time is dilated (running slow) in the muons frame of reference \n\nQ2:\n\tGluosn mediate hte strong nuclear forece in teh nucleus bonding nucleons together against the repulsive electromagnetic force\n\nQ3:\n\tConservation of lepton number\n\tConservation of baryon number\n\nQ4:\n\tThe diagram shows the decay of a neutron into a proton.
