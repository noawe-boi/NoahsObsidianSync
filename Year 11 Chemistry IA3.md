### Research and planning
#### Considered Rationale 

##### Claim: 
'Fossil fuels and biofuels produce carbon dioxide in their combustion'
Evaluate the impact of fossil fuels and biofuels on the environment

*Do biofuels produce less carbon dioxide per kWh of energy produced??*

`Choose a biofuel`

##### Investigate phenomena associated with claim
- Why are these fuels different (molecules)
- What happens during combustion (bonds broken etc)
- Enthalpy 
- 

##### Demonstrate development of the research question from the claim
- What effect does more or lack of $CO_2$ have



##### Specific and relevant research question 


##### Relevant Sources




#### Analysis and interpretation
