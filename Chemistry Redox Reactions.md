## What are redox reactions??
Redox reactions are reactions that involve the transfer of electrons between atoms. 
These reactions convert chemical potential energy to electical energy. 

## Reduction and Oxidation reactions
**Redox** is an abbreviation for a pair or reactions where electrons are exchanged or transferred between reactants. These are *oxidation* and *reduction*. They cannot occur without eachother

### Oxidation
- When a chemical species loses one or more electrons

### Reduction
- When a chemical specs gains one or more electrons


### Example
$$4Na_{(s)} + O_2 \rightarrow 2Na_2O_{(s)}$$
In this example, Sodium loses and election, and oxygen gains two. This transfer results in $Na$ becoming $Na^+$, and $O$ becoming $O^{2-}$ 

**Sodium** has been **oxidized** and *oxygen* has been *reduced*


## Redox Terminology 
Redox Reactions can be remembered as the acronym
$$OILRIG$$
or:
- Oxidation
- Is
- Loss (of electrons)
- Reduction
- Is
- Gain (of electrons)


The *reducing agent* is the species that is *oxidized*
The **oxidizing agent** is the species that is **reduced**

## Predicting which reactant is reduced or oxidised 
Ionisation energy and electronegativity can be used to predicted which reactant is reduced, and which is oxidised
