### What is an electrochemical cell?
By separating the oxidizing and reducing agents and instead connecting them with a wire, 
#### Galvanic Cells
A galvanic cell converts *chemical energy to electrical energy* from **spontaneous** redox reactions

##### Electrodes
- May Contain an inert electrode
- If reactive, electrode may deteriorate throughout the reaction or have product deposited on it 
##### Anode
The electrode where oxidation occurs
##### Cathode
The electrode where reduction occurs 
###### To remember which is which 
Galvanic Cells involve **AN OX** and a *RED CAT*
i.e. anode is oxidation, reduction is at cathode.

##### The Salt Bridge
The salt bridge helps electrons balance out when the battery becomes saturated.
$KNO_3$ will always be a suitable salt bridge because it is always soluble

#### Electrolytic cell
An electrochemical cell that converts *electrical energy to chemical energy* from **non-spontaneous** redox reactions
