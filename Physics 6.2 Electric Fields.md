## Definition
An electric field is the region of space around a charge where a force would be exerted on the other charged particles

## Properties
- Field lines never cross
- Lines enter and leave particle at right angles
- The density of lines is proportional to the field strength.


### Electric Field Strength Formula
E = F/q
Where:
- E is the electric field strength of Q (in N/C or newtons/coulombs)
- Q is the first charged particle
- F represents the force experienced by q
- q represents the second charged particle
## Example
### 6.2A
#### Find the force experienced by the
