## Laws of motion
### Law 1
An object will remain at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force with dissimilar magnitude. 
### Law 2
Force is proportional to acceleration
$$ F=ma$$
Where:
$f=$ force $(N)$
$m=$ mass $(kg)$
$a=$ acceleration $(ms^-2)$ 
### Law 3
Each action (or force) has an equal and opposite reaction.


## Inertia
Inertia Is resistance to change
i.e. The object does not want to change its current state/motion
### Affected by
- Mass of object
- Magnitude of kinetic energy of object
