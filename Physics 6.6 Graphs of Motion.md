## Key Features of a Graph 
- Co-ordinands (or x and y values)
- Gradient
- Area Between graph and x-axis
These features are *not mandatory* but may be present

## Position-Time Graphs
- Axis represent position of object with respect to time
### Example
![[Physics position time graph example]]

#### Beginning
- Graph begins at origin
#### Start
- Increases at a constant rate from 0 to 25s (for 25s), reaching 50m
#### Rest
- at rest from 25s to 35s  (for 10s)
##### Area Between 25s and 35s
- $A=L \times w = st$$ 
- However this is irrelevant
#### End
- Decreases at a constant rate (returning to start) from 35s to 60s (for 25s)

### Gradient
$$grad = \frac{rise}{run}$$
which in the case of the graph,
$$grad=\frac{displacement/position}{time} = \frac{s}{t}$$
$$\therefore \:\;\;\;\; grad=Velocity=V$$
## Velocity-time graph
- Axis represent velocity with respect to timed
### Example
![[Velcoity time graph physics example]]
#### Beginning
- Initially travelling at 3m/s (for 4s)
#### Deceleration
- Begins to slow down at t=4s (for 2s)
#### At Rest
- Stationary from 6s to 7s  (for 1s)

#### Reverse
- Begins accelerating in the opposite direction from 7s to 8s (for 1s)
- Travelling at 1m/s backwards from 8s to 9s with constant velocity (for 1s)
#### Slows down
Slows down from 1m/s backwards to rest


### Gradient

$$grad = \frac{rise}{run} = \frac{\Delta V}{t}$$
$$\therefore \space grad = acceleration$$

### Area
$$A=LW=Vt$$
Since $v=\frac{s}{t}$, $vt=s$, $\therefore$ 
$$ Area=displacement $$ ![[Velcoity time graph physics example 2]]


## Acceleration-time graph

### Gradient
- Irrelevant!

## Area
$$Area = LW = at = Velocity$$
