## What are outer molecular forces?
Forces that occur between complete molecules, like between water molecules in a cup of water

## What do these forces effect?
### Melting/Boiling points
- Stronger inter molecular forces $\implies$ Higher melting/boiling points
### Vapour Pressure
- Stronger inter molecular forces $\implies$ lower vapour pressure. i.e. lower pressure required to cause liquid to vaporise
### Solubility
#### Polar Molecules
Form stronger hydrogen, and dipole dipole bonds
Water soluble (because water is a polar molecule)
#### Non polar molecules
Form weak dispersion forces
Insoluble in polar solvents
soluble in polar solvents
