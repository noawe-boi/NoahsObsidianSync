The red sun robs their beauty

What do you think would happen if the atmosphere disappeared? The first thing you would think of is the intensity of the suns rays. It would probably be a little hotter. This would be an issue, however, the worst problem we would face would be the new wavelengths of emissions, the ones that were completely blocked before. No one had ever been exposed to them before. 
As the atmosphere seperated, the sky became a dark red
Their faces droop as the sun's rays being tearing apart their bodies. The ozone had reacted unexpectedly to experiments. What was meant to save the human race had unleashed the full spectrum of the sun's rays onto our inhabitants. 
anyone outside received a full dose of waves of various spectra. Some were absorbed, some transmitted and some reflected. The result of all was complete annihilation of any organic matter
anyone inside was fine at first, but minutes later, once they realized that the walls were searing hot, the room would begin to boil; and with the room, their bodies.
