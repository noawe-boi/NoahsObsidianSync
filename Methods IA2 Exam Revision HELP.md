### Sheet 1
#### Question 4
![[Pasted image 20250426112427.png|800]]

You literally just let $h=0.1, 0.01, 0.000000000001$ and observe effects on the result. $h=0.01\implies 1.79$, $h=0.0000000001\implies 1.79 \therefore$ it approaches 1.79 as $h$ approaches 0

#### Question 13

How many points do I actually need to plot when sketching??

Literally just the y intersect, what the intersect would have been if it was not translated (so its a nice whole number), and 'one period' out, like when x=e
