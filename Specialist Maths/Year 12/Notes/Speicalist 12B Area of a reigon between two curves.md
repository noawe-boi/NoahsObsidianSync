### Foundational concepts
#### Signed area vs Total area 
$\int ^b _a f(x) dx - \int ^b_a g(x) dx = \int ^b _a f(x) - g(x) dx$

### Big ideas and concepts
#### Distance between curves
The distance between $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ is given by $f(x)-g(x)$

### Procedures
- Check for intersections (by graphing)
- Take the definite integrate 
- use a calc (calc is short for calculator. its slang)

### Examples
