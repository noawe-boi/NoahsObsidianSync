### Foundational Concepts
#### Vectors
$ai+bj+ck$ 
- $a$ gives $x-$position
- $b$ gives $y-$position
- $c$ gives $z-$position
#### Differentiation
#### Integration
### Big Ideas and Concepts
#### What happens if the particle moves over time?
let $r(t)=x(t)i+y(t)j+z(t)k$
Then, 
- $x(t)$ gives $x-$position at time, $t$
- $y(t)$ gives $y-$position at time, $t
- $z(t)$ gives $z-$position at time, $t$
These are still functions, so calculus as be applied. 
	We can find the gradient or area under the curve through differentiation and 

### Vocab and definitions
$r(t)=x(t)i+y(t)j+z(t)k$
	Where $i, k, k$ are unit vectors
##### Then first derivative is: $$\dot{r}(t)=\frac{dx}{dx}i+\frac{dx}{dy}j+\frac{dx}{dt}k$$ 

$$[=\dot{x(t)}i+\dot{y(t)}k+\dot{z(t)}k]()$$
##### Then second derivative is
$$\ddot{r}(t)=\ddot{x(t)}i+\ddot{y(t)}k+\ddot{z(t)}k$$
