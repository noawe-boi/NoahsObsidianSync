### Foundational Concepts

#### The General idea
- We are proving that a statements holds generically, not just providing examples
- a **single** counterexample is enough to **disprove** a statement
#### Partial Sums of sequences
##### Sum of the first n terms of an Arithmetic Sequence 
$a+(a+d)+(a+2d)+...+(a+(n-1)d) = \frac{n}{2}(2a+(n-1)d)$


### Vocab and definitions
$\forall$ - For all
$\exists$ - There exists
$\implies$ - implies 
$\in$

### Big ideas and concepts
#### Writing numbers generically in proofs
- Even numbers can be written in the form $2n$
- Odd numbers can be written as $2n \pm 1$ 
- All numbers can be expressed as either
	- $2n$, $2n+1$
	or
	- $3n$, $3n+1$, $3n+2$

Let $a,b,\in \mathbb{Z}$ 
- $a+b\in \mathbb{Z}$
- $a-b \in \mathbb{Z}$
- $ab\in \mathbb{Z}$
