### Big ideas and concepts
Consider the product rule 
![[The product rule]]

We differentiate with respect to $x$ on both sides
$\int \frac{d}{dx}(uv)dx=\int\left(u\frac{d}{dx}+v\frac{du}{dx}\right)dx$
$\therefore uv=\int (u\frac{dv}{dx})dx+\int(v\frac{du}{dx})dx$
Sometimes one component of an equation is easier to differentiate 

$\therefore \int (u\frac{dv}{dx})dx=uv-\int(v\frac{du}{dx})dx$
### Vocab and definition
![[Integration by parts formula]]

### Procedures
1. Choose which component will integrate easily
	This will be $v$
2. Choose which component will become less complex as you differentiate it
	make this $u$
3. $\frac{dv}{dx}=1$ if only one term
