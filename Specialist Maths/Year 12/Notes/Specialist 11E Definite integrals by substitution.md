### Foundational Concepts
#### Reverse chain rule
$\int f(x) \cdot \frac{du}{dx} = \int f(u) du$
#### Definite integrals
Subbing in bounds

### Big ideas and concepts
#### The big idea and concept
If we are integrating with respect to $u$, rather than with respect to $x$, then we need our bond to be $u$ values, not $x$ values.
### Vocab and definitions
#### Repalcing x bounds
Use $u=f(x)$ to replace $x$ bounds with $u$ bounds
### Procedures
#### Look for 
- $f(u) \cdot \frac{du}{dx}$
- a simplified function by replacing an inner function with $u=f(x)4
- make substituation
- integrate
- Evaluate bounds
