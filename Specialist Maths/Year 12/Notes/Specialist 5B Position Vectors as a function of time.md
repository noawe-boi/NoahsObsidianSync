### Foundational Concepts
#### [[Specialist 5A Vector Functions]]

### Big ideas and concepts
#### t for time $(t \leq 0)$
#### Unit circles constructed from trig
Consider example
- $x^2 + y^2 = 1 \rightarrow$ unit circle centered at origin
- $r(t)=\cos(t)i+sin(t)j \rightarrow$ Also a unit circle centered at origin

 With $r(t)$, we know when a particle was at a particular point

### Vocab and definitions
#### Motion in 2 dimensions
$r(t) = x(t)\mathbf{i} + y(t)\mathbf{j}$
#### Motion in 3 dimensions
$r(t) = x(t)\mathbf{i} + y(t)\mathbf{j} +z(t)\mathbf{k}$

### Procedures
#### Translating
We will either
- Convert to Cartesian equation
or
- Substitute values
#### Parametric Equations
We can also graph parametric equations on graphics calculator
#### Paths crossing vs collisions
##### Path Crossing
Two particles in the same place
##### Collision
Two particles in the same place AT THE SAME TIME
