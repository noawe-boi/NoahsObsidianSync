### Foundational Concepts
#### Definite Integrals

### Big ideas and concepts
#### Integration, bounds, and area
Integrating gives us area under a function, within domain of the bounds. 

We can consider the area under a function as a function of the end bound (given that the starting bound remains constant)

This function can then be graphed and analysed. 

### Vocab and definitions
#### Integration in respect to bounds
We can integrate a function in one variable using a different variable as our upper or lower bound.
