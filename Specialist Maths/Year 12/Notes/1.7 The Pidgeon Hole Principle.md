### Vocab and definitions
#### Number Ceilings
The ceiling of a number $x$ is denoted by $\lceil x \rceil$ and is the smallest integer greater than **or** equal to $x$ 
$\lceil 5 \rceil = 5, \lceil 5.0000001 \rceil = 6$  

#### Pigeon hole principle
If $n$ objects are to be placed in $k$ boxes, then at least one box will contain $\lceil \frac{n}{k} \rceil$ objects 

### Big ideas and concepts
#### Even groups
If we split into even groups, how many groups must there be

### Key processes
