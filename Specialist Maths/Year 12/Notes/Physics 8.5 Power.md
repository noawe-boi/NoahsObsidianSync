## What is power
The rate at which work is done or amount of energy that can be expended in a fixed period of time

### The units for power are
- Watts (W)
- J/s 
A Watt is 1 Joule/per second


### The formula for power!
$$P=\frac{W}{t}$$
Where 
- W is work
- T is time
- P is power

#### Note
$$P=\frac{Fs}{t}, P=Fv$$ Where 
- F is force
- s is displacement
- v is velocity
