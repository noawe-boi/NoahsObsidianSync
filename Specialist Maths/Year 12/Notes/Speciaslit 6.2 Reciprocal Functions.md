### Foundational concepts
#### asymptotes
#### $\frac{1}{a}$
- As $a$ gets small, $\frac{1}{a}$ gets bigger
- As $a$ gets bigger, $\frac{1}{a}$ gets smaller
- Has the same sign as $a$
- $\frac{1}{0}$ does not exist

### Big ideas and concepts
#### $\frac{1}{f(x)}$
- Verical asymptotes where $f(x) = 0$ 
- Horizontal asymptote at $y=0$ if:
	$x\rightarrow \infty$ 
	or 
	$x \rightarrow - \infty$
- Local min where $f(x)$ has a local max 
	As long as it's not at $x$-axis
- Local max where $f(x)$ has a local min
	As long as it's not at $x$-axis
### Vocab and defintions
#### Valid points on graph
If $(a, b)$ is a point on the graph $y=f(x)$ where $b\neq 0$, then $(a,\frac{1}{b})$ will be a point on the graph $y=\frac{1}{f(x)}$. 
### Procedures
#### Graphing reciprocals 
- Graph $y=f(x)$
- Consider characteristics
	- $x$ ints
	- does $x\rightarrow \pm \infty$ 
	- does $f(x) \rightarrow \pm \infty$ 
	- Local min and max 
	- Graph reciprocal characteristics 
		- Asymptotes
		- min/max 
- Join
