### Foundational Concepts
#### Remember:
$\sin^{-1}(x), \cos^{-1}(x), \tan^{-1}(x)$ are the angles that give the ratios.
These (except tan) are only defined for $-1\leq 0 \leq 1$
### Big ideas and concepts
#### Inverse trig functions
These are still functions that can be differentiated and integrated.
