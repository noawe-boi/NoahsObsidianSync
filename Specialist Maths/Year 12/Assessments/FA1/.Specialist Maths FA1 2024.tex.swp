\section{Introduction}


\subsection{Premise}
- Study aims to find optimal mirror placement in order to light as much of the cave as possible




\subsection{Assumptions}
\par
In Order for a solution to be formed, a set of constants must be assumed.
\\
- Light brightness does not decrease as it travels through the cave and bounces off mirrors
\\
-

\subsection{Observations}
\par
- Light can be modelled as a vector
\\
- Mirrors will stand parralel from the ground and entend to the ceiling, Dimentions unknown... Possibly variable
\\
- Light will reflect so that $angle \: of \:incidence = angle \: of \: refraction$, or
