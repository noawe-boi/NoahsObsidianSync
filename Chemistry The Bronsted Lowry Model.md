### Basics of the model
An acid acts as a proton ($H^+$ ion) donor, and bases act as proton acceptors
	An acid will donates a proton ,and the base will accept it


### $H^+$ and oxygen bonding
The oxygen molecule has two *lone pairs*. These are valence electrons that do not bond. Even though bonding usually only occurs on the 2 remaining bonding electrons, $H^+$ can be attracted to the lone pairs regardless. This forms $H_3O$

Therefore there aren't actually $H^+$ ions in solution.
	$H^+$ is easier to use in calculations however the $H_3O^+$ ion
