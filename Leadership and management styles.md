### Autocratic  
im the boss do this 

manager is in complete control and makes all the decisions alone 

Good if there is a great leader but workers can feel unempowered and silence intrapeneaurs 
### Persuasive 
do this and this is why you should

manager is in complete control but explains why they make decisions
can silence intrapreneurs who may be benneficial to the company 

### Consultive
how do you think you should do this??

employees feel more empowered and valuable when it comes to decision making

takes a lot of time (yappers)

### Participative 

Hey everyone what/how should we all do to do this

Promotes communication and allows staff to lean from other members (gaining experience and credulity)

is even more time consuming (more yapping and conflicting views)
### Lassez-faire

Ok guys figure it out yourselves im in the back seat

Makes employees feel empowered and in control 

No guidance or power to provide a more solid sense of direction
