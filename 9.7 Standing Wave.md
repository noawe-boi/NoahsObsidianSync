#physics 

- formed by the Superposition (interference) of 2 Progressive waves that are:
	- At the same frequency and amplitude
	-  travelling in the opposite direction
<<<<<<< HEAD


![[Standing waves diagram]]
- Standing waves are the result of resonance
- They occur later in natural frequencies


### Nodes and antinodes
=======
	- have a length that is an odd multiple of a quarter wavelength of the standing wave 
 ![[Standing waves diagram]]
>>>>>>> origin/main
##### Nodes:
Points of total destructive interference (no movement)

##### Antinodes:
 Points of total constructive interference (the most displacement)

Nodes and antinodes remain in fixed positions for a specific frequency of vibration



Pipes
- Woodwind instruments create sound by sending air vibrations down a pipe until the sound waves coming in create interference with the waves that have already been reflected. 
- at specific frequencies this will create rensonance
