#physics 

- formed by the Superposition (interference) of 2 Progressive waves that are:
	- At the same frequency and amplitude
	-  travelling in the opposite direction
	- have a length that is an odd multiple of a quarter wavelength of the standing wave

##### Nodes:
Points of total destructive interference (no movement)

##### Antinodes:
 Points of total constructive interference (the most displacement)
