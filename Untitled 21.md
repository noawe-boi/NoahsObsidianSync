### Introduction

In chemical reactions, understanding the changes in enthalpy (ΔH) is crucial for comprehending the energy exchanges that occur. This experiment aims to investigate the enthalpy change when varying amounts of magnesium carbonate (MgCO₃) react with a constant volume of hydrochloric acid (HCl). By measuring the temperature change and calculating the enthalpy change, we can gain insights into the thermodynamic properties of this reaction.

### Background

Magnesium carbonate reacts with hydrochloric acid in an exothermic reaction, releasing heat as it produces magnesium chloride, water, and carbon dioxide: MgCO3(s)+2HCl(aq)→MgCl2(aq)+H2O(l)+CO2(g)\text{MgCO}_3 (s) + 2\text{HCl} (aq) \rightarrow \text{MgCl}_2 (aq) + \text{H}_2\text{O} (l) + \text{CO}_2 (g)MgCO3​(s)+2HCl(aq)→MgCl2​(aq)+H2​O(l)+CO2​(g)

The enthalpy change for this reaction depends on the amount of reactants and the efficiency of energy transfer within the system. Understanding how different quantities of MgCO₃ affect the temperature change and overall enthalpy can help in applications ranging from industrial processes to academic studies in thermodynamics.

### Considered Rationale

The experiment's rationale is based on systematically varying the amount of MgCO₃ while keeping the volume and concentration of HCl constant. This approach allows for an isolated investigation into the effect of the solid reactant on the thermal properties of the reaction.
