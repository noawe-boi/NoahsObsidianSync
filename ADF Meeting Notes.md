### Why ADF?
#### Interest in mechanics/electronics
- Been taking things apart since I was little
- Interest in systems
	- Made by many people to acheive a single goal. 
	- Why are things the way they are (what decisions were made during the design process)

#### University
- Considering doing engineering degree with ADF however unsure whether I'll enjoy life in the ADF. 
- This is a good way or me to get a feel for what it's like, while learning about a field I'm interested in along the way.
