### Foundational Concepts
#### Reverse differentiation
Integration is just reversing the process of differentiation 
#### Remember
$\int \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} \; dx=ln(f(x))+c$

### Big Ideas and concepts
#### Remember
If I know what I differentiated to get a function, then I know what I get when I integrate it

### Procedures
#### Problem solving
- What do I know?
- What am I trying to figure out
- What is one thing I can do to get one step closer
- Repeat!
