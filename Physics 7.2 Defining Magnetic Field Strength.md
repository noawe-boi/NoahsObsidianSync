## Wires and magnetic fields
A current carrying wire will produce a revolving magnetic field perpendicular to the wire 

The direction of the magnet field can be found using your right hand. This method is caleld Amperer's RIght hand rule.

## Magnetic Field Diagram Symbols

![[Magnetic Field DIagram symbols]]

$B = \frac{N_0}{2\pi} * \frac{I}{R}$
Where $\frac{N_0}{2\pi} = 2x10^-7 TmA^-1$
$I$ = Current 
$r$ = distance between current and point of B 
$B$ = magnetic field strength
