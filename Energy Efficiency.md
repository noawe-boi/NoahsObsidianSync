### Energy is usually 'lost'  as heat. 
- Energy used is referred to as the input and is converted into other forms of energy
- the useful energy resulting from this transformation is the output. 

### The efficiency of an energy transfer is a measure of how much useful energy is produced and can be expressed as 

 E = (useful energy output/total energy output) x 100
 where:
 - E = [[Energy Efficiency]]




### Examples

##### A basketball is bouncing and each bounce it loses energy 
total energy = [[Gravitational Potential Energy]] = m x a x h1
where:
- m = [[Mass]] in Kg
- a = [[Acceleration]] in m/s
- h1 = [[Height]] the basketball was dropped from in meters

useful energy = [[Gravitational Potential Energy]] = m x a x h2
where:
- m = [[Mass]] in Kg
- a = [[Acceleration]] in m/s
- h2 = [[Height]] the basketball **RETURNED TO after the initial bounce** in meters

therefore 
E = (useful energy/total energy) x 100
