## Pascals Formula
### Foundational Concepts
#### $^n C _r$
 $^n C _r = \frac{n!} {r!(n-r)!}$

### Vocab and Definitions
#### Pascals Triangle

	and so on...

$^2 C _1 = \textrm{Row 2, Position 1}$

#### Pascals formula
$^n C _r = ^{n-1}C_{r-1} + ^{n-1}C_{r}$

### Big ideas and Concepts

#### $^n C r$ 
$^n C _r = \frac{n!} {r!(n-r)!}$ 

#### Pascals Formula
$^n C _r = ^{n-1}C_{r-1} + ^{n-1}C_{r}$

### Big Ideas and Concepts
#### Predictable patterns
- Can lead to construction of formula or rule. 
### Vocab and definition
#### The row sum
The sum of row n is pascals triangle is $2^n$ 
#### The hockey stick property
If you add the numbers going down any diagonal starting with 1 and stopping at any point then the sum will be equal to the number in the next row, slightly to the left of the last numb
er added.
