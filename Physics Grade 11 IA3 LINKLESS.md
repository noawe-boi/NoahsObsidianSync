### Claim

Electromagnetic radiation around the home, such as inductive chargers or Wi-Fi, is dangerous to human health.

### Background

#### Short intro saying how there is wifi and 5g bill gates nano chip vaccine everywhere now??

#### What is EMF:

_EMFs and electromagnetic radiation are not the same thing._

Electromagnetic Radiation, Electromagnetic waves, or EMFs, are all terms used to describe the transmission of energy through waves called photons. Photons have no mass and are generated when electrons or other charged particles are excited enough to change energy levels. Particles emit photons when this change in energy level occurs. EMFs are not a single type of wave but an entire spectrum, not all of which is harmful to human health. For example, waves between wavelengths 380 to 700 nanometers are what make up the visible spectrum of light, which people constantly absorb every day.

Talk about how waves with higher frequencies are absorbed easier.

#### Ionising vs non-ionising radiation:

EMFs with very short wavelengths are considered to have higher energy than EMF with larger wavelengths. EMF waves that carry enough energy can be considered 'Ionising.' This means that they have enough energy to remove electrons from atoms, or 'ionise' them. Ionising radiation can be in the form of alpha, beta, gamma, or X-rays, with alpha having the least amount of energy and potential to penetrate barriers, and gamma having the highest.

Ionising radiation's ability to ionise poses a high risk to DNA and cells within the body. Doses of exposure to ionising radiation in excess of 100mSv have been linked to the development of cancer, and intense doses can destroy DNA, making it impossible for cells to reproduce. Non-ionising radiation cannot directly alter DNA but can pose a risk to the body. For example, microwaves are a common household appliance that most commonly operates at 2.45GHz. This frequency creates an optimal wavelength for polarised water molecules to rapidly rotate and create friction between each other, which then creates heat. This heating can cause burns, brain injury, or impairment of DNA cells. Additionally, the World Health Organization has classified non-ionizing radiation between the frequencies of 30kHz to 300GHz as Group 2B carcinogens, meaning that they have the potential to cause cancer in humans.

#### Why do these devices emit EMF and at what frequencies:

Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) is a wireless communication and networking system that encodes information into radio waves to provide internet access to devices such as phones or computers. By design, it creates significant EMFs between the frequencies 2GHz and 6GHz. Wireless Power Consortium's 'Qi' is a set of specifications, or standards, that nearly every phone equipped with wireless charging follows. The Qi charging standard utilises frequencies between 87kHz and 207kHz. Other, lower-power, devices may use inductive coupled wireless changing, which relies on, and operates using, the 50Hz to 60Hz oscillation of the AC power supplied from the grid. While these devices create EMFs, any other appliances running on grid power will also create the same fields via the flow of current in house wiring.

Maybe mention that in the future there will likely be higher frequency Wi-Fi. Like how cellular also became higher frequency.

### Research Question

At what amplitude do Electromagnetic Fields between 2GHz-6GHz and 87kHz-205kHz become harmful to human health?

## Body

### Source 1

Figure 1 shows conductivity and skin depth penetration of waves at frequencies ranging from 150MHz to 10GHz in different types of tissues. EMFs at these frequencies do not possess enough energy to ionise; however, as stated previously, they still have the ability to cause harm. The more conduction and penetration through tissue is possible, the higher the absorption and potential for damage in said tissue.

It can be observed that as the frequency of the wave increases, the conductivity or S/m value decreases, however, penetration decreases.

**Why is penetration decreasing if conduction increasing?**

From that source: _RF fields do not ionise cell genome or damage cells and tissues in any direct way, but research indicates that they affect living organisms via thermal effects (tissue heating) and non-thermal effects such as vibration and rotation of molecules (especially those that have an asymmetric charge or that are polar in structure), oxidative stress, genetic damage, or altered cell membrane permeability._ _Exposure to EMFs can damage biological tissues by inducing changes, which can be explained in terms of thermal or non-thermal mechanisms. Thermal effects can occur with the conversion and absorption of heat by the body's electromagnetic energy. Increased body temperature is stabilized and alleviated by blood circulation. Although non-thermal effects do not raise the body temperature sufficiently to impair the structure of tissues, their effects can still be seen as an increase in free radical production in tissues. EMFs, no matter where they occur in the frequency spectrum, are reported to cause a rise in levels of oxygen free radicals in an experimental environment in plants and humans._
