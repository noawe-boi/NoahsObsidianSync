#### Constructive Interference
- Two waves are added together to form a higher amplitude
![[Constructive Interference]]

#### Destructive Interference
- Two waves cancel each other out resulting in a smaller amplitude
![[Destructive Interference]]

#### Interference from 2 point sources

##### Total Constructive Interference
- Occurs hen the path difference is a multiple of Lambda
- When: path difference = n X
- where n x Lambda 1,213...



![[Iterference from 2 point sources]]


##### Total Deuctive interference 
- When Path difference = (n+(1/2)) x Lambda
