### Strings Fixed and both ends
- Nodes at both ends of the string (points that do not move)
- Fundamental Frequency (or Fundamental Harmonic) occurs when there is one antinode
- Seconds Harmonic occurs when there are 2 antinodes. 
- Third Harmonic occurs when there are 3 antinodes


| Harmonic | Number of antinodes | Length Equation |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Fundamental | 1 | L = Lambda/2 |
| Second | 2 | L = (2 x Lambda) /2 = Lambda |
| Third | 3 | L = (3 x Lambda) / 2 |

The relationship between L and Lambda is 
- **L = (n x Lambda) / 2**
 or 
- **L = (N x V) / (2 x F)**

Where:
- L = length of string (m)
- Lambda = Wavelength (m)
- n = Harmonic Number
- f = Frequency of the wave (hz)
- v = speed of the wave (m/s)



### Strings Fixed Only at one end
- An antinode at open end is required to form standing wave

| Harmonic    | Conditions                   | Equation                                     |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Fundamental | Single Antinode at fixed end | L = L/4 = One quarter wave length            |
| Third       | 2 antinodes                  | L = (3 x Lambda) / 4 = 3 quarters wavelength |
| Fifth       | 3 antinodes                             | L = (5 x Lambda) / 4 = 4 fifths wavelength   |
| n'th Harmonic            |                              | L = (n x Lambda) / 4. Where n = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc                                             |
