### What is it

[[Ester]]ification is a condensation reaction between [[Carboxylic Acid]] and [[Alcohol]] that generates an [[Ester]]

The main chain of the [[Ester]] is derived from the main chain of the [[Carboxylic Acid]]. The [[Alcohol]] main chain form the ester substituent

Esters are weak acids because they are in equilibrium with parent carboxylic acids. As a result, an ester turns litmus paper from blue to red. 
### Requirements
- Heat
- Trace amounts of mineral acid catalyst such as sulfuric acid. It is a reversible reaction
### Formula
$$\textrm{Carboxylic Acid + Alcohol} \rightarrow \textrm{Ester + Water}$$

In general: **(something)-anol + (other thing)-oic acid** $\rightarrow$ **(something)-yl + (other thing)-oate.**
