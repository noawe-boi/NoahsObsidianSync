### What was the typical family structure in Iceland in the 1820s?
Most families were impoverished as hell and would basically just have kids to they could work, and then their kids would grow up impoverished and the cycle would repeat. 

### What were the common living conditions and housing arrangements
The impoverished people would live in houses carved into the landscape. These provided mild insulation from the cold, and were better than nothing, but were incredibly unsanitary. This helped disease propagate throughout households, which were often cramped, further exasperating the issue.
### What were the main sources of food and methods of food preparation
Since the main industry in Iceland was agriculture, the working class would grow their own food. They grew mostly grains, however livestock such as sheep were also cultivated for their wool and meat.
