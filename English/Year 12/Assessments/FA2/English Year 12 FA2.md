### Introduction
It's no breaking news that many disabled people face unjust treatment daily. But what is constantly overlooked is the extent this injustice is embedded into the organisations designed to help them live normal lives. We aren't just talking about a few bad eggs here, but a system that allows deliberate neglect and profiteering on societies most venerable.

#### Thesis
Disabled people are facing systematic oppression and exploitation from the very people who are meant to be serving them, and helping them live independent lives. 

People assume that just because someone is disabled they cannot, or do not deserve to, experience a high quality of life
### Hospitals 

#### Finlay's case
While not always the case, many people with disabilities find themselves with a number of other underling conditions that impact their lives. 

An investigation by the University of Melbourne shockingly titled "Australians with disability are 4 times more likely to die early", reveals just that. While disappointing, the increase in early moralities falls in line with society's expectations. Clearly people with health issues relating to their disabilities will live shorter lives than otherwise healthy individuals. That would be the case if the reasons that disabled people were dying early were actually related to their pre-existing condition. 

I omitted the last part of that title, " – often not due to their disability"

"When Finlay Browne died at just 16 years old, 'Down syndrome' was listed on his death certificate as a cause of death. But Finlay did not die of Down syndrome" (Disney et al., 2024)

The study found that "people with disability are dying of conditions such as cancer, heart disease, chronic lung conditions and diabetes at a much higher rate than the rest of the population." (Disney et al., 2024)

These conditions aren't caused, or related to specific disabilities at all, and while not completely preventable, the data should show relatively equal moralities for both people with, and without disabilities.

Don't just think of people in wheelchairs, with down syndrome, or with obesity; Think of people who are blind or deaf! Why are disabled people of all kinds dying earlier from conditions that we can mitigate. 

The study points out three major issues that are contributing to these high numbers: lack of accessibility, discrimination, and a general disregard for the health of disabled patents. One of the largest issues when it came to this neglect was poor communication between healthcare professionals signalling a lack of effort and a devaluation of lives.

### NDIS "Farming"
However, healthcare isn't the only sector discriminating against people with disabilities. An article by The Saturday Paper titled "The view from inside the NDIS" details the experience of, among others, Luke Stickels. Stickels is now a registered NDIS support worker and coordinator, however much of the reason he is successful now, is because of the hardships he endured while supporting his late brother, Justin. 

Stickels witnessed first hand the neglect and exploitation his brother was subjected to on a daily basis. While some organisations put the effort in to "maximise [Justin's] independence and quality of life goals", there were just as many willing to blatantly exploit his intellectual disability for profit. One specific provider would Justin occasionally, then blatantly bill for a 3 hour visit.  

I find it ironic that in the very system's established to help people with disabilities live "normal" lives, they are often treated more like paychecks than people.

The article further cites an interview with a woman under the pseudonym Rebecca, a fellow support worker, who highlights that one of the rarer factors that contribute to desirable outcomes for supported individuals is "Good communication and feedback between parties involved in peoples care", which as mentioned earlier, is particularly lacking in the healthcare sector.


### AIHW Study

The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) measures a variety of factors to measure when and where, and how discrimination is occurring, as well as its impact. Their most recent update to their dataset displayed trends in line with what the anecdotal evidence would suggest.

14% of all people with disabilities stated that at least one time in the last year, they have avoided visiting medical facilities, such as the GP, dentist, or hospital.

25% of people with disabilities aged 15–64 who had experienced discrimination from health staff due to their disability avoided healthcare facilities.

Something feels off though... If the government is the one collecting all these statistics, they have to be aware of the issue, and therefore should be doing something about it... right?
### Despite this... disability royal commission response
