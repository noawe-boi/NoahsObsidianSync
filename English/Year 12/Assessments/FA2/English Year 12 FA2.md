### Introduction
It's no breaking news that many disabled people face unjust treatment daily. As if it were not hard enough to live as a physically less capable person, society's bad actors are constantly finding new ways to make their live's harder for their own gain, while experiencing little to no consequence's for their actions.

#### Thesis
Disabled people are facing systematic oppression and exploitation from the very people who are meant to be serving them, and helping them live independent lives. 

People assume that just because someone is disabled they cannot, or do not deserve to, experience a high quality of life
### Hospitals 
While not always the case, many people with disabilities find themselves with a number of other underling conditions that impact their lives. 

An investigation by the University of Melbourne shockingly titled "Australians with disability are 4 times more likely to die early", reveals just that. While disappointing, the increase in early moralities falls in line with society's expectations. Clearly people with health issues relating to their disabilities will live shorter lives than otherwise healthy individuals. That would be the case if the reasons that disabled people were dying early were actually related to their preexisting condition. 

I omitted the last part of that title, " – often not due to their disability"

The paper starts with a tragic story. "When Finlay Browne died at just 16 years old, “Down syndrome” was listed on his death certificate as a cause of death. But Finlay did not die of Down syndrome" (Disney et al., 2024)

The study found that "people with disability are dying of conditions such as cancer, heart disease, chronic lung conditions and diabetes at a much higher rate than the rest of the population." (Disney et al., 2024)
These conditions aren't caused, nor related to specific disabilities at all, and while not completely preventable, the data should show relatively equal moralities for both people with, and without disabilities.

Don't just think of people in wheelchairs, or people with down syndrome. Think of people who are blind or deaf! Why are these people dying earlier from conditions aren't hereditary or predisposed?

The study points out three major issues that are contributing to these high numbers: lack of accessibility, discrimination, and a general disregard for the health of disabled patents. One of the largest issues when it came to this neglect was poor communication between healthcare professionals, which indicates that doctors are putting less effort into 

While the first issue is the result of poor infrastructure, the last two are the fault of bad actors in an industry intended to save lives, not neglect them.

### NDIS "Farming"
However, healthcare isn't the only sector discriminating against disabled individuals. An article by The Saturday Paper titled "The view from inside the NDIS" details the experience of, among others, Luke Stickels. Stickels is now a registered NDIS support worker and coordinator, however much of the reason he is successful now, is because of the hardships he endured while supporting his brother, Justin. Stickels experienced first hand the neglect and exploitation his brother was subjected to on a daily basis. 

While some organisations put the effort in to "maximise \[Justin's\] independence and quality of life goals", there were just as many willing to blatantly exploit his intellectual disability for profit. I find it ironic that the very system established to help people with disabilities live "normal" lives, they are often treated more like numbers than people.
