### Introduction
It's no breaking news that many disabled people face unjust treatment daily. As if it were not hard enough to live as a physically less capable person, society's bad actors are constantly finding new ways to make their live's harder for their own gain, while experiencing little to no consequence's for their actions.

#### Thesis
Disabled people are facing systematic oppression and exploitation from the very people who are meant to be serving them, and helping them live independent lives. 

People assume that just because someone is disabled they cannot, or do not deserve to, experience a high quality of life
### Hospitals 
While not always the case, many people with disabilities find themselves with a number of other underling conditions that impact their lives. 

An investigation by the University of Melbourne found that Australians with disabilities were up to 5 times more likely to die early. While disappointing, the increase in early mortalities falls in line with society's expectations. Clearly people with health issues relating to their disabilities will live shorter lives than otherwise healthy individuals. That would be the case if the reasons that disabled people were dying early were actually related to their preexisting condition. 

The paper starts with a tragic story. "When Finlay Browne died at just 16 years old, “Down syndrome” was listed on his death certificate as a cause of death. But Finlay did not die of Down syndrome" (Disney et al., 2024)

The study found that "people with disability are dying of conditions such as cancer, heart disease, chronic lung conditions and diabetes at a much higher rate than the rest of the population." (Disney et al., 2024)
These conditions aren't caused, nor related to specific disabilities at all, and while not completely preventable, the data should show moralities for both people with, and without disabilities.

Don't just think of people in wheelchairs, or people with down syndrome. Think of people who are blind or deaf! Why are so many people dying earlier of their conditions aren't hereditary or predisposed?

A number of factors were found to contribute to these numbers.

However, healthcare isn't the only sector discriminating against disabled individuals.
