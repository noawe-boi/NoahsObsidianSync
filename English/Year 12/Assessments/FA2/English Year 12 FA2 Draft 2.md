### Introduction


Good morning community members, caregivers, and friends
Some of you probably know better than anybody the hardships and discrimination that comes with having a disability, however today I'm here to tell you that its not getting better.
If you're not currently aware of the extent to which people with disabilities are disadvantaged in ways far greater than physical ailments, then I hope you inform you today of when and where it is happening most, and what we can do about it as a community. 

### Hospitals 

An investigation by the University of Melbourne shockingly titled "Australians with disability are 4 times more likely to die early", reveals just that. While disappointing, the increase in early mortalities falls in line with society's expectations. Clearly people with health issues relating to their disabilities will live shorter lives than otherwise healthy individuals. That would be the case if the reasons that disabled people were dying early were actually related to their pre-existing condition. 

I omitted the last part of that title, " – often not due to their disability"
*insert vsauce beat drop*
*LEAD INTO THIS*

"When Finlay Browne died [in hospital] at just 16 years old, 'Down syndrome' was listed on his death certificate as a cause of death. But Finlay did not die of Down syndrome" (Disney et al., 2024)

Browne initially collapsed at home. When he started vomiting, and blood was found in his feces, his parents took him to the emergency room. However rather care for him, the nurses placed him in a non emergency bed, where he waited "several hours" before a doctor even examined him.

Although his bowel obstruction was his official cause of death, his parents as well as advocacy groups argue that neglect was the true culprit.

Tragedies such as Browne's, and the death certificates of nearly 500,000 Australians, give  quantifiable evidence that "people with disability are dying of conditions such as cancer, heart disease, chronic lung conditions and diabetes at a much higher rate than the rest of the population." (Disney et al., 2024)

These conditions aren't caused, or related to specific disabilities at all, and while not completely preventable, the data should show relatively equal moralities for people with, and without disabilities.

Don't just think of people in wheelchairs, with down syndrome, or with obesity; Think of people who are blind or deaf! Why are people with disabilities of all kinds dying earlier from conditions that we can mitigate. 

The study points out three major issues that are contributing to these high numbers: accessibility issues, discrimination, and poor communication between healthcare professionals. 





![[Pasted image 20250422063627.png]]

According to the Australian Institute of Health and Well-being, In 2022 , 11% of people with disabilities found it difficult to access medical facilities.

In addition to inaccessibility, it was found that 14% of people with disabilities had actively avoided visiting a medical facility, such as a dentist, GP, or hospital at least once 43% of those that avoided medical facilities did so because they had experienced discrimination within those facilities.

All three of these issues are, in my opinion, inexcusable. 
While healthcare facilities are mandated to be architecturally accessible by law, not everyone is financially or intellectually capable enough to simply take an uber or a taxi. Without carers or support networks around them, the only way some make it to the hospital is in an ambulance.

There exist patients with much more complex issues than what are affecting people with disabilities, and robust systems to share the details of such. The abundance in poor communication signals a lack of effort and a devaluation of lives on the healthcare providers side. 

A more distressing issue is that people with disabilities may not be able to detect discrimination, or have the resources to act against it. Issues like this are often complex, and there's no miracle cure for them. Recently recommendations were made to federal government outlining a reform to the reporting system. While they were "accepted in principle", which we will touch on later, they have essentially been put aside indefinitely.

### NDIS cutoff and stress
What is arguably worse than receiving subpar care is being locked out of support entirely. 

Ros Collins, the 95 year old mother of her son, Dan, found herself as his only lifeline after he was hospitalised just seven days before his birthday. Dan was left with significant brain injury, which reduced his short term memory capacity substantially. 

While Dan's injury was before his 65th birthday, the age which separates NDIS and aged care support, legislation says that he is not eligible to NDIS benefits since he was not receiving them prior to hitting that cutoff and therefore must settle for an inadequate aged care package. This has forced Dan, described by Collins as ambitious and lively, to likely live out the rest of his days in "God's waiting room."

Even those with lifelong, or even degenerative conditions have been put under the iron recently.

Under new reforms that came into effect in October last year many changes to the "support-needs assessment tool", intended to determine the severity of individuals disability and extent of care they required, have caused significant distress among disabled individuals and caregivers alike. 

one woman received a request in the mail from the National Disability Insurance Association (NDIA) which asked her to prove that she was still eligible for support she was receiving for her chronic and permanent illnesses within 28 days, or risk having her supposedly "lifelong" plan revoked.

Despite the urgency and pressure the NDIS was willing to put her under, they seemed much less willing to reveal exactly what information they required. She revealed in an interview, "They would not give me a definite answer"

The guardian details that one man was put under review, not because there was doubt regarding the degree of their disability, but simply because the NDIA did not have a digital copy of his ID.

Why should people with disabilities have to constantly worry that they're going to have the rug pulled out from under them? Surely 

### Despite this... (disability royal commission response)

A royal commission is an independent investigation into an issue relating to the Commonwealth's responsibilities. The investigating party is given sufficient power to scrutinise all facets of an issue and parties involved in order to determine  who is responsible, how and why they did it, and what can be done.

The Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability received nearly 8000 submissions of evidence, and shed light on numerous despicable cases of - as the name suggests - Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation.

an ABC news article on the report details, 

"Australians were told what it felt like to live with intellectual disability and be sexually assaulted in your own home by your support worker.

To search your local tip for scraps to fix your wheelchair.

To have your child removed from you right after birth.

To be paid $2.50 an hour for manual labour, or to be denied a job simply because you were disabled."

What is just as disappointing is the governments response to the report. Out of the 172 recommendations made to the federal government, only 13 were accepted, or implemented in full. These changes were allegedly already in the pipeline and seem to have been accepted due to their convenience. 
Although 117 were accepted in principle, which seems like a good thing, this wording is vague enough to sound supportive, without actually creating commitment or plans regarding implementation.

### So what can we do? (Conclusion)
It's downright absurd to assume that awareness alone, or a twitter hashtag, will instantly fix disability injustice. Fighting for equality in a distinctly inequitable world is an uphill battle, however as a collective, its our responsibility to support and stand up for people with disabilities when appropriate. 

The more we let disability become taboo and avoid talking about how it affects us and the people around us, the less we can do about it. 

If you or someone you know with a disability has been discriminated against, you can launch a complaint with "People with Disability Australia" at www.pwd.org.au, who can assist with making a report to the Australian Human Rights Commission or other appropriate agency.

If anything, we need to put pressure on the government to accept the framework and solutions that have already been presented to them, instead of allowing them to put it off indefinitely.
