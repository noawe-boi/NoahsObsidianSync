### Introduction

Good morning community members, caregivers, and friends. Some of you probably know better than anybody the hardships and discrimination that come with having a disability, however today I'm here to tell you that its not getting better. Regardless of whether you are currently aware of the extent to which people with disabilities are disadvantaged in ways far greater than physical ailments, I hope to inform you today of where and when it is happening most, and what we can do about it as a community.

### Hospitals

An investigation by the University of Melbourne shockingly titled "Australians with disability are 4 times more likely to die early", reveals just that. While disappointing, the increase in early mortalities falls in line with society's expectations. Clearly people with health issues relating to their disabilities will live shorter lives than the typical person. That would be the case if the reasons that disabled people were dying early were actually related to their pre-existing condition.

I omitted the last part of that title, " – often not due to their disability" (Disney et al., 2024).

"When Finlay Browne died [in hospital] at just 16 years old, 'Down syndrome' was listed on his death certificate as his cause of death. But Finlay did not die of Down syndrome" (Campanella, Lloyd, & Branley, 2024).

Browne initially collapsed at home. When he started vomiting, and blood was found in his faeces, his parents took him to the emergency room. However rather than care for him, the nurses placed him in a non emergency bed, where he waited "several hours" before a doctor even examined him.

Although his bowel obstruction was his official cause of death, his parents as well as advocacy groups argue that neglect was the true culprit.

Tragedies such as Browne's, and the death certificates of nearly 500,000 Australians, give quantifiable evidence that "people with disability are dying of conditions such as cancer, heart disease, chronic lung conditions and diabetes at a much higher rate than the rest of the population" (Disney et al., 2024).

These conditions aren't caused, or related to specific disabilities at all, and while not completely preventable, the data should show relatively equal mortalities for people with, and without disabilities.

Don't just think of people in wheelchairs, with down syndrome, or with obesity; Think of people who are blind or deaf! Why are people with disabilities of all kinds dying earlier from conditions that we can mitigate.

Well, the study points out three major issues that are contributing to these high numbers:

##### Accessibility issues

The first, accessibility issues. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, in 2022, 11% of people with disabilities found it difficult to access medical facilities (AIHW, 2024). While these facilities are mandated to be architecturally accessible by law, not everyone is financially or intellectually capable enough to simply take an Uber or a taxi. Without carers or support networks around them, the only way some make it to the hospital is in an ambulance. 

##### Discrimination

In addition to inaccessibility, it was found that 14% of people with disabilities had actively avoided visiting a medical facility, such as a dentist, GP, or hospital at least once. 43% of those that avoided medical facilities did so because they had experienced discrimination within them (AIHW, 2024).

A more distressing issue is that people with disabilities may not be able to detect discrimination, or have the resources to act against it. Issues like this are often complex, and there's no miracle cure for them. Recently recommendations were made to the federal government outlining a reform to the reporting system. While they were "accepted in principle", which we'll touch on later, they have essentially been put aside indefinitely.

##### Poor communication

There exist patients with much more complex issues than what are affecting people with disabilities, and robust systems to share the details of such. The abundance in poor communication signals a lack of effort and a devaluation of lives on the healthcare providers side (Disney et al., 2024).

##### The Result?

The result of all this? Your loved ones could be the next Finlay.

### NDIS cutoff and stress

Subpar care isn't the only issue affecting disabled people, as some are locked out of care entirely for arbitrary reasons.

Ros Collins, the 95-year-old mother of her son, Dan, found herself as his only lifeline after he suffered a debilitating meningitis infection just seven days before his birthday. Dan was left with significant brain injury, which reduced his short term memory capacity substantially.

While Dan's injury was before his 65th birthday, the age which separates NDIS and aged care support, legislation says that he is not eligible to NDIS benefits since he was not receiving them prior to hitting that cutoff and therefore must settle for an inadequate aged care package. This has forced Dan, described by Collins as ambitious and lively, to likely live out the rest of his days in "God's waiting room" (Collins, 2025; Neeland, 2025).

Under new reforms that came into effect in October last year, many changes to the "support-needs assessment tool", intended to determine the severity of individuals disability and extent of care they required, have caused significant distress among disabled individuals and caregivers alike.

One woman received a request in the mail from the National Disability Insurance Association (NDIA) which asked her to prove that she was still eligible for support she was receiving for her chronic and permanent illnesses within 28 days, or risk having her supposedly "lifelong" plan revoked. Another man was at risk of having his plan revoked simply because the NDIA lacked an updated copy of his photo ID (Convery, 2025).

At this point in time, the NDIS system is full of pitfalls and traps that not only exclude, and forces people to fight for support, but can pull the rug out from underneath them at any moment (Stickels, 2024).

### Disability royal commission 

While the idea of a disability support scheme working against its clients is shocking, it reflects the greater trend of failures within the disability sector.

The Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability received nearly 8000 submissions of evidence, and shed light on numerous despicable cases of - as the name suggests - Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation (admin, n.d.).

An ABC news article on the report details: "Australians were told what it felt like to live with intellectual disability and be sexually assaulted in your own home by your support worker. To search your local tip for scraps to fix your wheelchair. To have your child removed from you right after birth. To be paid $2.50 an hour for manual labour, or to be denied a job simply because you were disabled" (Campanella & Young, 2024).

What is just as disappointing is the government's response to the report. Out of the 172 recommendations made to the federal government, only 13 were accepted or implemented in full. These changes were allegedly already in the pipeline and seem to have been accepted due to their convenience. Although 117 were accepted in principle, which seems like a good thing, this wording is vague enough to sound supportive, without actually creating commitment or plans regarding implementation (Young, 2024).

### So what can we do? (Conclusion)

It's downright absurd to assume that awareness alone, or a twitter hashtag, will instantly fix disability injustice. Fighting for equality in a distinctly inequitable world is an uphill battle, however as a collective, it's our responsibility to support and stand up for, and with, people with disabilities when appropriate.

We need to put pressure on the government to accept the framework and solutions that have already been presented to them, instead of allowing them to put it off indefinitely. I urge you to write to your local MP about your support for further implementation of the royal commission's recommendations.

If you or someone you know with a disability has been discriminated against, you can launch a complaint with "People with Disability Australia" at www.pwd.org.au, who can assist with making a report to the Australian Human Rights Commission or other appropriate agency.

If you feel inclined to, you can also donate to them to help them in their mission to "advance and protect the rights, health, safety and well-being of people with disability."

If you'd rather donate your time, PWDA also have volunteering opportunities on their website.

Thank you for your time. I hope together, we can hold our government, and each other, accountable, and help build a country where disability doesn't mean devaluation.
