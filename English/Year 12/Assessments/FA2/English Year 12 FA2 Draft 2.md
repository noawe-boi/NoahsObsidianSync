#### Thesis
People assume that government organisations and the healthcare system do nothing but improve the lives of people with disabilities. However, despite billion dollar reforms and one of the largest investigations into misconduct in history, people with disabilities are seeing little increase in quality of life in the current year, and some changes are even leaving some people without care. 
### Hospitals 

While not always the case, many people with disabilities find themselves with a number of other underling conditions that impact their lives. 

An investigation by the University of Melbourne shockingly titled "Australians with disability are 4 times more likely to die early", reveals just that. While disappointing, the increase in early moralities falls in line with society's expectations. Clearly people with health issues relating to their disabilities will live shorter lives than otherwise healthy individuals. That would be the case if the reasons that disabled people were dying early were actually related to their pre-existing condition. 

I omitted the last part of that title, " – often not due to their disability"

"When Finlay Browne died at just 16 years old, 'Down syndrome' was listed on his death certificate as a cause of death. But Finlay did not die of Down syndrome" (Disney et al., 2024)

The study found that "people with disability are dying of conditions such as cancer, heart disease, chronic lung conditions and diabetes at a much higher rate than the rest of the population." (Disney et al., 2024)

These conditions aren't caused, or related to specific disabilities at all, and while not completely preventable, the data should show relatively equal moralities for both people with, and without disabilities.

Don't just think of people in wheelchairs, with down syndrome, or with obesity; Think of people who are blind or deaf! Why are people with disabilities of all kinds dying earlier from conditions that we can mitigate. 

The study points out three major issues that are contributing to these high numbers: accessibility issues, discrimination, and poor communication between healthcare professionals. 





![[Pasted image 20250422063627.png]]

In 2022, 11% of people with disabilities found it difficult to access medical facilities.

In addition to inaccessibility, it was found that in 14% of people with disabilities had actively avoided visiting a medical facility, such as a dentist, GP, or hospital at least once . 43% of those that avoided medical facilities did so because they had experienced discrimination within those facilities.

All three of these issues are, in my opinion, inexcusable. 
While healthcare facilities are accessible by law, in terms of bring wheelchair and impairment friendly, many people with disabilities have trouble actually making it into these facilities. Many people with disabilities may not be financially or intellectually capable enough to simply take an uber or a taxi, and without carers or support networks around them, the only way they make it to the hospital, may be via an ambulance. 




Surely in the modern year there are systems in place to allow healthcare professionals to share and properly communicate their patients condition. There exist patients with much more complex issues than what are affecting people with disabilities. This issue signals a lack of effort and a devaluation of lives on healthcare providers side. 


A more distressing issue is that fact that many with intellectual disabilities, may not be able to understand that they are being discriminated against, or may assume that they are even when they are not. Issues like this are often complex, and there's no miracle cure for them. Recently recommendations were made to force the federal government to reform the reporting system. While they were "accepted in principle", which we will touch on later, they have essentially been put aside indefinitely.

### NDIS "Farming"
However, healthcare isn't the only sector discriminating against people with disabilities. An article by The Saturday Paper titled "The view from inside the NDIS" details the experience of, among others, Luke Stickels. 

Stickels, who is now a registered NDIS support worker,  witnessed first hand the neglect and exploitation his late brother, Justin, was subjected to on a daily basis. While some organisations put the effort in to "maximise [Justin's] independence and quality of life goals", there were just as many willing to blatantly exploit his intellectual disability for profit. One provider would call Justin occasionally, then bill the NDIS for a 3 hour visit.

### NDIS cutoff and stress
What is arguably worse than receiving subpar care is being locked out of support entirely. 

Ros Collins, the 95 year old mother of her son, Dan, has found herself as his only lifeline after he was hospitalised just seven days before his birthday. Dan was left with significant brain injury, which reduced his short term memory capacity substantially. 

While Dan's injury was before his 65th birthday, the age which separates NDIS and aged care support, legislation says that he is not eligible to NDIS benefits since he was not receiving them prior to hitting that cutoff and therefore must settle for an inadequate aged care package. This has forced Dan, described by Collins as ambitious and lively, to likely live out the rest of his days in "God's waiting room."

Even those with lifelong, or even degenerative conditions have been put under the iron recently.

Under new reforms that came into effect in October last year many changes to the "support-needs assessment tool", intended to determine the severity of individuals disability and extent of care they required, have caused significant distress among disabled individuals and caregivers alike. 

one woman received a request in the mail from the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIA) which asked her to prove that she was still eligible for support she was receiving for her chronic and permanent illnesses within 28 days, or risk having her supposedly "lifelong" plan revoked.

Despite the urgency and pressure the NDIA was willing to put her under, they seemed much less willing to reveal exactly what information they required, saying "They would not give me a definite answer."

The guardian details that one man was put under review, not because there was doubt regarding the degree of their disability, but simply because the NDIA did not have a digital copy of his ID.

Why should people with disabilities have to constantly worry that they're going to have the rug pulled out from under them? 

### Despite this... (disability royal commission response)

A royal commission is an independent investigation into an issue relating to the Commonwealth's responsibilities. The investigating party is given sufficient power to scrutinise all facets of an issue and parties involved in order to determine  who is responsible, how and why they did it, and what can be done.

The Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability received nearly 8000 submissions of evidence, and shed light on numerous despicable cases of - as the name suggests - Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation.

an ABC news article on the report details, 

"Australians were told what it felt like to live with intellectual disability and be sexually assaulted in your own home by your support worker.

To search your local tip for scraps to fix your wheelchair.

To have your child removed from you right after birth.

To be paid $2.50 an hour for manual labour, or to be denied a job simply because you were disabled."

What is just as disappointing is the governments response to the report. Out of the 172 recommendations made to the federal government, only 13 were accepted, or implemented in full. These changes were allegedly already in the pipeline and seem to have been accepted due to their convenience. 
Although 117 were accepted in principle, which seems like a good thing, this wording is vague enough to sound supportive, without actually creating commitment or plans regarding implementation.

### So what can we do? (Conclusion)
It's downright absurd to assume that awareness alone, or a twitter hashtag, will instantly fix disability injustice. Fighting for equality in a distinctly unequal world is an uphill battle, however as a collective, its our responsibility to support and stand up for people with disabilities when appropriate. 

The more let disability become taboo and avoid talking about how it affects us and the people around us, the less we can do about it. 

If you or someone you know with a disability has been discriminated against, you can launch a complaint with "People with Disability Australia" at www.pwd.org.au, who can assist with making a report to the Australian Human Rights Commission or other appropriate agency.

If anything, we need to put pressure on the government to accept the framework and solutions that have already been presented to them, instead of allowing them to put it off indefinitely.
