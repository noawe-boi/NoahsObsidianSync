### Title

Something about sacrifice idk yet

### Hook & Introduction

*   **Start with a compelling hook: a striking quote, a brief anecdote, or a thought-provoking statement about war's impact on humanity.**


*   **Introduce the concept of sacrifice or resilience in war literature—why do these themes continue to resonate?**
If you take a bit of war, and boil it down to its simplest form, all you are left with is a set of strategic decisions and sacrifices from both sides, not just on the front lines, but also within society. However, these sacrifices aren't just physical, like death or loss of property, but can be metaphorical, or epistemic. 
Sacrifice and loss in texts and media can prompt reflection on our own personal values and moral dilemmas, and reveal the extreme choices that arise in life-or-death situations. 
**more here**


*   **Mention the two chosen texts and their significance in depicting war.**
	- One is a true and shocking story
	- One is an immersive and relatable made up story

*   **Set up the angle of the article: How do these texts shape public conversations about war and its consequences?**
	
	- However makes us consider the moral dilemmas and issues that people in war would have to face. 

### Exploring the First Text

*   **Briefly introduce the novel (Schindler's Ark) and its war context.**

'Schindler's Ark', by Thomas Keneally depicts the true story of Oskar Schindler, a WWII industrialist who, between 1938 and 1945 (https://echoesandreflections.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Companion_Resource_to_Schindlers_List_Bios.pdf), was responsible for saving roughly 1200 Jewish workers, who he employed at his enamelware and ammunition's factory, from concentration camps like Auschwitz.

The main challenge Oskar faced at this time was the immense oppression and mass execution of Jewish individuals during the war. "They don’t have a future, Schindler. That’s not just old-fashioned Jew-hate talking, I assure you. It’s policy." (INSERT REFERENCE)

*   **Highlight how it represents sacrifice through character journeys, key moments, or historical realities.**
Death and sacrifice were abundant throughout Schindler's story, not only surrounding Schindler, but among all of those impacted by the war effort. 

Schindler himself sacrificed his safety, security, and profits for the sake of his Jewish workers. Masses of money and litres of liquor practically flowed from Schindler's pockets and into those of SS Guards, NCO's Investigators, SS Officials, and hundreds of other's on a regular basis to spare both himself and workers from prosecution and execution. 

Sacrifice is not just a tax for the persecuted and attacked though. The atrocities committed by SS Soldiers could not have been natural for many, and therefore it can be said that they must have partially sacrificed part of their humanity in order to serve their leaders by submitting to the brainwashing and propaganda of the Nazi party. 

"Doctor H" had to face a moral dilemma and intentionally poison four terminally ill patients rather than attempt an escape from the ghetto and let them face execution by automatic weapon. 


*   **Consider: What does this novel add to the broader conversation on war literature?**
War has a way of pushing people to the extreme ends of the spectrum both when it comes to nationalism and stubbornness. While its easy to think of conflict as an "us VS them" scenario, books like Schindler ark can spark discussion that challenges the binary aspect of friend or foe.

### Bringing in the Second Text

*   **Introduce the second text (Jojo Rabbit) and its unique take on war.**
 'Jojo rabbit', a film written, directed by, and starring Taika Waititi, is a satirical take on WWII from the perspective of a Johannes "Jojo" Betzle, a 10 year old  boy obsessed with the Nazi regime, and his imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler!

 Jojo and Imaginary-Hitler both believe that Jewish people are disgusting and deadly creatures, however when Jojo finds himself face to face with Elsa, a Jewish girl his mother provided with refuge in her home, his only option is to befriend her, lest he face prosecution for harbouring her. Jojo attempts to interrogate Elsa to gain insight on and document the strengths and weaknesses of the "Jews" so, and the Nazi Party, can be better equipped to take them on. However as he learns more about Elsa and the events that lead her to his home, his feelings of hatred turn to sympathy.

*   **How does its medium (film) shape the emotional impact or message?**

As a film, 'Jojo Rabbit' is able to reach new audiences in creative and impactful ways. I strongly believe that as a novel, it would have seen much less success. In fact, the film was adapted from the novel "Caging Skies", by Christine Leunens, to which I had not heard about until I saw "Jojo Rabbit". Seeing Hitler fly through a second story window, hearing the gunfire as Captain K and the other soldiers are executed, or feeling the tension in the air as the Gestapo search Jojo's house are all immersive and dynamic scenes that help viewers engage and relate with the characters on a deeper level.

 The bright and modern interior of Jojo's house as well as the colourful streets become a grotesque juxtaposition to the events occurring within them. When we see Jojo's mother lifeless in the town centre, the colour subtly disappears from the world, subconsciously highlighting the magnitude of the loss to viewers, and the climax of consequences that his mother endured for "\[doing\] what \[she\] \[could\]".

*   **Compare/contrast it with the novel: Does it challenge, reinforce, or expand the discussion on sacrifice?**

Evidently, just like 'Schindler's Ark', physical sacrifice is a major theme in 'Jojo Rabbit'. Another example of this is when, facing almost certain death after being defeated in battle by the invading Americans, Captain K pulls a ruse on them and manages to convince them that Jojo is Jewish by spitting on him and telling the soldiers that he '\[doesn't\] know \[that\] **dirty** Jew'. By sealing his own fate and expediting his own death, Captain K sacrifices his own life for the sake of Jojo's.


Earlier in the movie, when the Gestapo "inspect", or more accurately, ransack Jojo's house, Captain K shows up, claiming to have gotten a flat tire while riding his (Rosie's)  bike. When the Gestapo find Elsa, they are rightfully suspicious of her. However, using Jojo's dead sister Inge's Aryan papers, she is able to avoid suspicion when Captain K volunteers to inspect their legitimacy, and despite various inconsistencies, Captain K gives the 'all okay'. 

Any sort of rebellion or treason against the Nazi party was a serious offence, and considering that the Gestapo had just had Jojo's mother hung for spreading Anti-Nazi material, It's safe to say that Captain K's fate would have been sooner rather than later if the Gestapo called his bluff. 

However by sacrificing his safety, he was able to save the life of Elsa and Jojo because, as Captain K said himself, "If you see a Jew, you tell us, we tell the Gestapo, they tell the SS, and then they go out and they kill the Jew. And anyone who helped the Jew. And, because these are very paranoid times, probably some other people just in case"


While the theme physical of sacrifice is less apparent in 'Jojo Rabbit', much of it takes a different form. Many of the sacrifices that Jojo must endure are not physical, but epistemic.

Jojo had to sacrifice his previous mindset and prejudices towards the Jewish people in order to embrace the new truth and has such difficulty doing so because, without the information Jojo gathered from propaganda and "Hitlers Youths", he wouldn't know what to expect from Elsa. This fear of the unknown kept Jojo from dismissing his previous beliefs and the internal conflict because of this is materialises, and climaxes when Jojo has a fight with "Imaginary-Hitler" and decides that he is better off without him. 

Jojo must realise and grow from the fact that "Imaginary-Hitler" was a crutch; supportive and comforting in the short term, but nonetheless a burden at some point that prevented Jojo from living the life he deserved, free from antisemitism. 

 This may prompt viewers to consider their own beliefs and how willing they are to accept new truths 



### Why This Matters

*   **Step back and reflect: How do these works contribute to the ongoing cultural and literary conversation about war?**
Both "Schindler's Ark" and "Jojo Rabbit" change how viewers see war stories by exposing the messy, human elements within them that arise under the circumstances. Schindler's transformation from Nazi profiteer to saviour pushes the idea of inherent heroism, the idea that everyone has the potential for heroic actions if they are able to act selflessly in the face of danger. Jojo's Journey from indoctrinated to empathetic can cause audiences to consider whether their biases are taught, rather than innate. 
These works confront and reject the "Good vs Evil" framework and instead start new conversations by highlighting how war forces ordinary people to make impossible choices and by doing so, they reframe sacrifice not as a noble and righteous endeavour, but a survival tactic.

*   **Are they confronting war's brutality, humanising its participants, or offering hope amid destruction?**
	"Schindler's Ark" depicts mass and systematic genocide but is able to counter hopelessness and despair by sprinkling in Schindler's incremental acts of rebellion. His story shows that while complacency and complicity with the terrible acts committed by the SS was rampant, redemption is possible through costly action.
	"Jojo Rabbit" uses satire to disarm viewers, while also juxtaposing absurd humour, like Captain K approaching battle with a cape and tassels, with visceral tragedy, like his execution mere moments later. This creates an entertaining film while still confronting the inherent brutality and of war
	


*   **How do they encourage readers/viewers to think differently about war or sacrifice?


### Conclusion - A Final Thought

*   **End with a thought-provoking insight or question: ~~Why do we keep telling these stories?~~**
What would you do in the shoes of Jojo, Schindler, or even Captain K?
	 I doubt you would have what it takes to sacrifice your own safety and the safety of your family to save a single Jew ngl.
	Its easy to look back and think "yeah I would have done something about it" but nah you wouldn't 
	texts like Jojo and Schindler both make us consider the fact that we would probably be just as helpless and complacent in similar scenarios, unwilling to make sacrifices like Jojo or Schindler. 

*   **Consider how literature and film shape our collective memory of war and whether they challenge or reinforce dominant narratives.**


*   **Perhaps reference modern conflicts—how does war literature of the past connect with the wars of today?**
