## Suggested Structure Guide for IA1 Literary Article

### Title

(A compelling, engaging title that hints at the discussion—e.g., The Cost of War: Stories of Sacrifice and Survival in Literature)

### Hook & Introduction

*   Start with a compelling hook: a striking quote, a brief anecdote, or a thought-provoking statement about war's impact on humanity.


*   Introduce the concept of sacrifice or resilience in war literature—why do these themes continue to resonate?


*   Mention the two chosen texts and their significance in depicting war.


*   Set up the angle of the article: How do these texts shape public conversations about war and its consequences?


### Exploring the First Text

*   Briefly introduce the novel (Schindler's Ark OR The Cellist of Sarajevo) and its war context.

'Schindler's Ark', by Thomas Keneally depicts the true story of Oskar Schindler, a WWII industrialist who, between 1938 and 1945 (https://echoesandreflections.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Companion_Resource_to_Schindlers_List_Bios.pdf), was responsible for saving roughly 1200 Jewish workers who he employed at his enamelware and ammunition's factory.

The challenge oskar faces at this time is the immense opression and mass execution of Jewish individuals during the war. 

*   Highlight how it represents sacrifice or resilience—through character journeys, key moments, or historical realities.


*   Consider: What does this novel add to the broader conversation on war literature?


### Bringing in the Second Text

*   Introduce the second text (Jojo Rabbit OR Wilfred Owen's poetry) and its unique take on war.


*   How does its medium (film or poetry) shape the emotional impact or message?


*   Compare/contrast it with the novel: Does it challenge, reinforce, or expand the discussion on sacrifice or resilience?


### Why This Matters

*   Step back and reflect: How do these works contribute to the ongoing cultural and literary conversation about war?
    *   Schindler: other side is bad!
    *   Jojo: sympathize w/ Germans


*   Are they confronting war's brutality, humanising its participants, or offering hope amid destruction?


*   How do they encourage readers/viewers to think differently about war, sacrifice, or resilience?


### Conclusion - A Final Thought

*   End with a thought-provoking insight or question: Why do we keep telling these stories?


*   Consider how literature and film shape our collective memory of war and whether they challenge or reinforce dominant narratives.


*   Perhaps reference modern conflicts—how does war literature of the past connect with the wars of today?
