## Considering the question
### Example
*By the end of the novel, Agnes has come to terms with her past. To what extent to you agree with this statement?*
#### What to look for
##### Main subject
The main subject is going to be the subject of your report
	In this example case, it is "*Agnes has come to terms with her past*"

We should consider what we know about the main subject of the novel and all aspects of it in order to make connections. 
**Brain storm to generate ideas!!**
	What is agnes's past?
		- She was born illegitimate
		- She was abandoned
		- She has a lot of trauma
		- Natans murder
		- inga's death
		- Treatment by society (specify which society)
		- etc

After considering these, we should consider how they relate to the main question in the subject
	Has agnes come to terms with Natan's murder??
	etc

##### Time period
What part of the novel are we responding to?
	In this example case, it is "*By the end of the novel*", so at the end.
##### Magnitude (optionol)
Some questions will ask you "to what extent". A response to this should be of magnitude and supported by evidence
##### Writers intention
Did the writer of the question hint at what opinion they are looking for?
	No example in this one
##### Etc
- *Come to terms*
	She is okay with it now?

#### Thesis statement
Respond to the question asked. This can literally be as if you are responding like someone asked you. In the case you are asked to give magnitude, ensure you actually do state it. 
	Through the relationships that Agnes forms in the text, Kent suggests that Agnes has come to terms with the past to a minimal extent
#### Justify your thesis (Body)

## Utilising Hannah Kent's narration style
### Perspective
This story is in first, and third person perspective. We need to be able to interpret and justify this with reasoning. 
	e.g. Kent has chosen to write the story in *x* perspective at *y* time in order to *z*
### Time
Thinks story is nonlinear. The use of flashbacks (often told to us via dialogue) give us a really good insight into different points and events throughout Agnes' life and the impact that these events had, and still have on her. 
### Fragmented narrative style
Use of historical documents
