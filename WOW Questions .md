### Q17: What does the bible say about sex before marriage

So it says uhhhh, don't have sex before marriage.

But in all seriousness, you've probably heard about marriage being the union of two people, both metaphorically, as they now share responsibility over the household, and physically, through... you know... sexual relations. 

Genesis 4:1 says: Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain.

This is what sex and marriage were intended to be: a personal weaving together of two lives, akin to knowing someone on a deep and profound level.

I think a metaphor that can illustrate this point is by considering sex as a tool, like a hammer. If you wanted to use a hammer to sink a nail, it would be an effective tool, just like how using sexual relations to form a deeper connection with your partner is an effective way to find further fulfillment in your relationship. 

However, if you consider trying to use a hammer to remove branches from a tree, it's going to take a lot more effort, and you might not even get the job done, or injure yourself in the process. This is like trying to use sexual relations to achieve short term pleasure. Even though you might feel good for a bit, you'll find yourself hurt, or unfulfilled in the long term. 

1 Corinthians 6:12-14

 “I have the right to do anything,” you say—but not everything is beneficial. “I have the right to do anything”—but I will not be mastered by anything" ... The body, however, is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord.

### Q18 Why is it easier to have faith when you are younger.

When I was about 8 or 9, I used to go to church every Saturday, pray every night, and sing in chapel. Nowadays you're more likely to find me asleep in chapel, rather than participating.

Ideas like "I'm too tired to go to church today", and, "I'm busy right now, God can wait" are intentional spiritual sabotage on ourselves, disguised as self care. I know because these are the reasons I lost my relationship with God.

These ideas don't just appear though. As I got older, more responsibilities fell on my shoulders. School was getting harder every year, I had new duties around the house, and my relationships with my fellow students grew more complex. These factors lead to me thinking more about myself, than my faith. 

I didn't realise it happening at the time, but I can only hope that you guys do, and not just if, but when, your faith is tested.

Matthew 18:3
"Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
