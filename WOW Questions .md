### Q17: What does god say about sex before marriage

Sex before marriage

So it's pretty clear the the bible is against sex before marriage, but not without a good reason. Back then, being a virgin was a big deal for women. 

In the case of arranged marriages, the woman's marriage was literally worth less if she wasn't a virgin, and often if a man took her virginity outside or marriage, he would have to pay a fine, and then marry her anyways. 

(Deuteronomy 22:13-21) describes a hypothetical scenario where a dude marries a girl, sleeps with her, and then claims she wasn't a virgin when they got married. We are told that if he was found to be lying about that, he would be fined 100 shekels of silver.

It was also a way for society to stay structured and to keep people accountable for their actions. Imagine how hard it would have been in bible times to get child support back when 

nowadays, we don't have fines, and I hope none of you are being forced into an arranged marriage, so waiting till marriage before you have sex with someone is more about morals, rather than condemnation.
Without a religious backbone, or set of rules, to govern our behavior, all sorts of immorality to thrive.
Either way I think its a red flag to be sleeping around.
