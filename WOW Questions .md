### Q17: What does god say about sex before marriage
Now I think we've all heard the 10 commandments. I'd like to focus on exodus 20:14

"Thou shalt not commit adultery."

I think a lot of people see this and they think of cheaters or maybe even people who sleep around a lot. However what a lot of us don't think about, and what society nowadays is so willing to accept as morally correct, is SEX BEFORE MARRAGE. 


While its not like having sex before marriage is going to kill you, and the idea of waiting till marriage seems super lame to a lot of you, you might be surprised to hear that 1 Corinthians 6:12 tells us that technically, we can do whatever we want with our bodies, however, we must be willing to accept the consequences that come with it.


Genesis 2:24 tells us that marriage is the uniting of man and wife, so that they may symbolically be considered a single entity. 

Besides, is it not a massive red flag if your partner has a really high body count? Even if you look at it through a non religious lens, would you rather know that your partner is fully committed to you and only you, so much that they could resist their desires to physically be united with you, until you are in a symbolic, and somewhat legal, entity. 


Without a religious backbone, or set of rules, to govern our behavior, all sorts of immorality to thrive

Would you rather have faith in your partner, rather than fear of their past?
