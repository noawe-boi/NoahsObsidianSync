### Q17: What does god say about sex before marriage

Sex before marriage

So it's pretty clear the the bible is against sex before marriage, but not without a good reason. Back then, being a virgin was a big deal for women. 

In the case of arranged marriages, the woman's marriage was literally worth less if she wasn't a virgin, and often if a man took her virginity outside or marriage, he would have to pay a fine, and then marry her anyways. 

Deuteronomy 22:13-21 describes a hypothetical scenario where a dude marries a girl, does the deed, and then claims she wasn't a virgin. We are told that if he was found to be lying about that, he would be fined 100 shekels of silver.

It was also a way for society to stay structured and to keep people accountable for their actions. Imagine how hard it would have been in bible times to get child support. Without a religious backbone, or set of rules, to govern our behavior, all sorts of immorality to thrive.

nowadays, we don't have fines, and I hope none of you are being forced into an arranged marriage, so waiting till marriage before you have sex with someone is more about morals, rather than condemnation.

1 Corinthians 6:12-14

 “I have the right to do anything,” you say—but not everything is beneficial. “I have the right to do anything”—but I will not be mastered by anything" ... The body, however, is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord.

Either way I think its a red flag to be sleeping around.

For some of us, ideas like "I'll pray tomorrow", and,
