# The Central Park 5

________

# Introduction 
## Documentary Introduction
#### Plot Synopsis

Lets set the scene. The year is 1989, New York city is the capital of racial violence, and 5 innocent boys aged 14 to 16 are in police custody for the alleged rape and attempted murder of a female jogger. Released in 2012, "The Central Park Five", Directed by Sarah Burns, Ken Burns and David McMahon, and retells the story of these 5 boys and their fight for justice and exoneration with a focus on how the media and its effect on society impacted their conviction.  

#### What position does the documentary persuade the audience to take on the topic
'The Central Park Five' makes its view very clear from the start that the boys are innocent, however, does little to take the blame off their shoulders. Viewers are told and shown that the boys are innocent, and from then, taken through the uphill battle that the accused fought not only against the charges put against them, but against the racial stereotypes and injustice they face throughout their conviction. It is stated and proven multiple times throughout the feature that the results of their trial were not determined by their actions on the night that the crime took place but, for some reason, the documentary still puts weight on their lawful actions that night, and finds its own ways to condemn them.
Jim Dwyer, a journalist that reported on the case while it was ongoing claimed that "the truth and reality and justice were not a part of it", and that, in reality, the case was just a proxy war fueled by the racial injustice that plagued the city of New York at the time. 

#### Is this position/representation fair or biased, do you agree or disagree?
In hindsight, this is obvious and the case is well regarded as one of the most well known examples of racial bias, misarrange and overall failures of both the justice system, and the media's ability to remain unbiased and factual. One place where 

However, just because this statement is objectively true, doesn't mean everyone agrees with it.

# Reasons That the representation needs to change

# Other Texts I Will Reference
## Netflix's 'When they see us'  
### Description
Netflix's 'When they see us' is dramatized retelling of the events of "The Central Park Five". While less factual, it is more engaging and is overall a more relatable and understandable portrayal of their character and case.

### Differences in representation
It focusses on the lives of the members of group before their involvement in the rape case as well as its impact on their personal lives.
Furthermore, it rightfully paints them as the victims they are and dives deeper into their demonized representation in the media and how it impacted their case, rather than the other way round. 


## George Floyd.
### Description
George Floyd's Case and the Central Park Five's cases are similar. In the Central Park Five's case, They had 13 years stolen by police, In Floyds case, he had his life stolen from him. 

while not a text from a specific author or outlet, the mainstream media coverage of Floyd's Death due to police brutality. 

 
### Differences in representation
Mainstream media reported that Central Park Five were guilty because they were willing to ignore. However, since mainstream beliefs have changed and the racial stereotypes are less prevalent, people were able to look past the fact that Floyd was a criminal and focus on the wrongdoings of the police involved who, unlike the police involved in the Central Park Five's case, were accountable for their actions.

Sympathy towards Floyd and his family was in significantly more abundance than in the Central Park Five's case too. as mentioned earlier, Floyd was seen as a victim, Unlike the Central Park Five, who in their documentary were blamed.

### Techniques

### Effect on Audience

## Media Coverage of event
***Show 0:48:50 to 0:49:53 (This is the news report with the kids in it)***
### Description
The Documentary compiles a number of news reports that covered the boys case at the time to demonstrate the public's knowledge and opinion of them and their case. The overwhelming consensus is extremely negative and biased against any chance the boys are innocent.

### Techniques

##### Editing/archival footage
These reports are shows in quick succession. Only a sentence or two from each report is ever heard before it is replaced with another. By showing a number of news reports and how they all have the same opinion, the true scale of their case, and the pervasiveness of the medias biased narrative as well as the focus on the boys race is demonstrated.
##### Juxtaposition
Before and after these news clips, we are shown interviews with members of the 'five ('The Central Park Five'), all of which depict them as well natured and respectful. This is a complete juxtaposition to how we hear them depicted by the media. 

### Effect on Audience

This scene and the techniques used within it allow the audience to see for themselves the extent that the 'five were vilified and misrepresented. These scenes also prepare the audience for the end of the documentary, where we are shown the lack of media coverage regarding the 'five's release.
