### Introduction 

Lets set the scene. The year is 1989, New York city is the capital of racial violence, and 5 innocent boys aged 14 to 16 are in police custody for the alleged rape and attempted murder of a jogger. 

### The media coverage of the event

The 5 boys were a part of a larger group of roughly 30 boys who were 'wilding', a practice where, in large groups or gangs, they harassed, attacked and robbed homeless people, joggers and civilians. c
As the night was wrapping up, police arrived and caused them to disperse. By the next day, 5 of the boys had been found, and taken to that police station for questioning. However, what was also found that next day was much more sinister than what police ever thought the boys were capable of.

***Show 0:48:50 to 0:49:53 (cut to be more concise)***
By sheer luck or blind confidence, the police department had found arrested the 5 assailants before the crime had even been discovered. Out of the 8 arrested from the group of 30, from all over the park, they had already found the 5 that had done it and gotten them to confess. The police must be really good at their jobs. 

***Show 0:57:20 where Police commissioner talking mad smack saying don't believe a word that these kids say***

or at least... that's what the events media coverage would have lead you to believe. 

### What they got wrong 

Remember how some news stations claims that their confessions were recorded? Lets have a look at one of these confessions. 

***0:46:00 to 0:47:xx where he literally makes it up*******

Isn't it a little weird how it almost seems like he's making it up as he goes? The detective even calls him out for it a few times. Kind of funny that we didn't hear about that from the police commissioner when he was talking about how bad they were.  

***Show 0:31:17 where they were manipulated into giving false confessions***

**
****The officers gave into the prejudices and feeling towards these boys and African American individuals that came from the worst examples of them as well as the media of the time had fed them, used it as justification to ignore clear evidence that not all of them could have raped that woman (add a little section about evidence that was ignored), then, the media took that, weaponized it and fed it right back to them and the public, confirming the false stereotypes**
=======
>>>>>>> origin/main


The media confirmed the prejudices of the public and gave the officers, in their mind,  justification to ignore clear evidence of not only the innocence of these boys, but likely many others at that time. The media took the case and used its severity and how quickly it was claimed to be resolved and fed it right back to the public as praise to the officers involved and a confirmation of their prejudices and stereotypes. 

### What they ignored (non inter-racial rape)








### Call to action/Conclusion
