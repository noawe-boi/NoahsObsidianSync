### Introduction 

Lets set the scene. The year is 1989, New York city is the capital of racial violence, and 5 innocent boys aged 14 to 16 are in police custody for the alleged rape and attempted murder of a female jogger. Released in 2012, "The Central Park Five", Directed by Sarah Burns, Ken Burns and David McMahon, and retells the story of these 5 boys and their fight for justice and exoneration with a focus on how the media and its effect on society impacted their conviction.  

From the start, viewers are told that the boys are innocent, and from then, takes viewers through the uphill battle that they fought not only against the charges put against them, but against the racial stereotypes and injustice they face throughout their conviction. It is stated and proven multiple times throughout the feature that the results of their trial were not determined by their actions on the night that the crime took place, in fact

"the truth and reality and justice were not a part of it" - Jim Dwyer
