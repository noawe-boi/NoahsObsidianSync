# The Central Park 5

________

# Introduction 
## Documentary Introduction
#### Plot Synopsis

Let's set the scene. The year is 1989, New York City is the capital of racial violence, and 5 innocent black and Latino boys aged 14 to 16 are in police custody for the alleged rape and attempted murder of a female jogger. Released in 2012, 'The Central Park Five', directed by Sarah Burns, Ken Burns and David McMahon, retells the story of these 5 boys and their fight for justice and exoneration with a focus on how the media and its effect on society impacted their conviction.  

#### What position does the documentary persuade the audience to take on the topic

'The Central Park Five' clearly states the boys are innocent, however, does little to take the blame off their shoulders. Viewers are taken through the uphill battle that the accused fought not only against the charges put against them, but against the racial stereotypes and injustice they face throughout their conviction. It is stated and proven multiple times throughout the feature that the results of their trial were not determined by their actions on the night that the crime took place but, for some reason, the documentary still puts weight on their shoulders, and finds its own ways to condemn them.

Jim Dwyer, a journalist that reported on the case while it was ongoing, claimed that **"the truth and reality and justice were not a part of it",** and that, in reality, the case was just a proxy war fueled by the racial injustice that plagued the city of New York at the time. 

#### Is this position/representation fair or biased, do you agree or disagree?
In hindsight, this is obvious, and the case is well regarded as one of the most well known examples of racial bias, miscarriage and overall failures of both the justice system, and the media's ability to remain unbiased and factual.
**However, just because this statement is objectively true, doesn't mean everyone agrees with it.** 

#### How does the public perceive this topic

In the modern day, its politically correct and generally accepted that victims of racial prejudice are victims of hate and violence, not seekers of it. Despite this, many individuals still believe that the **'five, as well as many other victims of racial attacks are at fault for them . Linda Fairstien, the prosecutor for the 'five's** case, continued to slander them for years after their exoneration, despite knowing that they could not have been the perpetrators. 



# Reasons That the representation needs to change

The representation of victims of racist attacks need to be changed in order to challenge existing racial stereotypes, the cause of these attakcs and to stop victims of racist attacks from being vilified instead of supported, uplifted and respected. 


# Other Texts I Will Reference
## Netflix's 'When they see us'  
### Description
Netflix's 'When they see us' is a dramatized retelling of the events of 'The Central Park Five'. While less factual, it is more engaging and is overall a more relatable and understandable portrayal of their character and case.

### Differences in representation
It focuses on the lives of the members of the group before their involvement in the rape case, as well as its impact on their personal lives.
Furthermore, it rightfully paints them as the victims they are and dives deeper into their demonized representation in the media and how it impacted their case, rather than the other way round. 


## George Floyd.
### Description 
George Floyd's Case and Central Park Five's case **are similar**. In the 'Central Park Five's case', they had 13 years stolen by police; In Floyd's case, he had his life stolen from him. 
The mainstream media coverage of Floyd's Death due to police brutality was overwhelmingly supportive and against the unlawful actions committed by those who were meant to be keepers of peace. While the perception and representation of victims of racial attacks has improved, some news outlets reported that Floyd died of a drug overdose, and not police brutality (No, George Floyd Court Documents Donâ€™t Prove He Died of Drug Overdose | Fact Check, n.d.)
 
### Differences in representation
Police, the media, and the public were adamant that the 'five were guilty because prevalent produces aligned with what they were accused of, persuading them to look last evidence of their innocence. However, since mainstream beliefs have changed and the racial stereotypes are less prevalent, people were able to look past the fact that Floyd was a criminal and focus on the wrongdoings of the police involved who, unlike the police involved in the Central Park Five's case, were held accountable for their actions.

Sympathy towards Floyd and his family was in significantly more abundance than in the 'Central Park Five's' case, too. As mentioned earlier, Floyd was seen as a victim, unlike the Central Park Five, who are still somewhat represented as at fault. 


# Key Scenes


## Arrest and interrogation scenes
***Show 0:31:17 where they were manipulated into giving false confessions***
### Description
These scenes show the footage recorded of the boy's interrogation, manipulation and false confessions. We are shown numerous examples of blatant lies and manipulation tactics that are notorious for resulting in confessions, false and true. 


### Techniques
##### Archival Footage
Instead of a reenactment, or a retelling, the documentary pulls actual footage of each boy's interrogation. This immerses viewers as the people they see are no longer just actors playing a role, but real people being taken advantage of and fighting for their freedom. 
##### Editing
The documentary takes specific moments from the boy's individual interrogations that highlight how the police broke them down and manipulated them.

##### Testimony 
Finally, in case law enforcements blatant misconduct and exploitation wasn't already apparent enough, the audience is presented with analysis of the tactics used against the boys from expert physiologists and lawyers. These segments are also intertwined with the boys interviews. 




### Effect on Audience
The use of these techniques helps the audience put themselves in the shoes of each member of the 'five. The distinct lack of sympathy in these scenes from neither law enforcement nor narrators makes the 'five seem somewhat at fault. Michael Joseph, A Defense Attorney even shames the parents of each of the prosecuted. He exclaims "Why would a parent not say at that moment 'we want to consult with an attorney'." While this is a valid statement, they would not have needed any legal guidance if the police had not taken forced false confessions. 

## Media Coverage of event
***Show 0:48:50 to 0:49:53 (This is the news report with the kids in it)***
### Description
The Documentary compiles a number of news reports that covered the boys case at the time to demonstrate the public's knowledge and opinion of them and their case. The overwhelming consensus is extremely negative and biased against any chance the boys are innocent.

### Techniques

##### Editing/archival footage
These reports are shown in quick succession. Only a sentence or two from each report is ever heard before it is replaced with another. By showing a number of news reports and how they all have the same opinion, the true scale of their case, and the pervasiveness of the medias biased narrative as well as the focus on the boy's race is demonstrated.
##### Juxtaposition
Before and after these news clips, we are shown interviews with members of the 'five ('The Central Park Five'), all of which depict them as good-natured and respectful. This is a complete juxtaposition to how we hear them depicted by the media. 

### Effect on Audience

This scene and the techniques used within it allow the audience to see for themselves the extent that the 'five were vilified and misrepresented. These scenes also prepare the audience for the end of the documentary, where we are shown the lack of positive media coverage regarding the 'five's release.
## Craig wonder and Saul Kassin discussing the lack of media attention regarding their release
 ***Show 1:48:46 to 1:49:01 then 1:50:00 to 1:50:20***
### Description
These Scenes are a compilation of interviews with Craig Wonder, a historian, and Saul Kassin, a phycologist, where they discuss the aftermath of the case and media coverage of the 'five's innocence. 
### Techniques

##### Editing/narration/Direct Interviews/montage
Throughout these interviews, we see a montage of media coverage from the time regarding the new evidence that proves the 'five are innocent. 

### Effect on Audience
By directly presenting viewers with information, these scenes act almost like a concluding exposition dump. Additionally, the showcasing of media coverage from the time adds to the credibility of both interviewees claims and helps viewers better understand the kinds of opinions that people at the time would have been exposed to. Overall, this further contributes to the subtle idea that the boys were somewhat at fault still, even when proven innocent. 


# Conclusion/Call to action
Overall, 'The Central Park Five' accurately retells the story and conclusion of one of the most infamous examples of racial prejudice, bias of mainstream media and denial of justice. While the documentary does take subtle jabs at the boys when it comes to whether they were somewhat at fault for their arrest and conviction, it never accuses them of actually committing a crime and brings to light the wrongful actions of higher powers as well as the lack of attention their eventual exoneration received. 
Saul Kassin said it best 
don't think the press faced its mistakes [and] I don't think the police department faced the truth of what had happened - Saul kassin

I ask you to face your own mistakes and the mistakes of others both past and present. Ask yourself in future whether the people you are attacking are at fault, or victims of your own twisted beliefs.
