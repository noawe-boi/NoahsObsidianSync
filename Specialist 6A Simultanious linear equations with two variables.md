### Foundational Concepts
#### Simultaneous equations

#### Geometric interpretation
(lines)

Consider:
$4x+2y=14$
$\therefore y=-2x+7$
Therefore we can geometrically interpret simultaneous equations

### Big ideas and concepts
#### Number of solutions for simultaneous equations
A pair of simultaneous equations  linear equations can have:
- One solutions
- Zero solutions
- Infinite solutions

### Vocab and definitions
#### Types of parallel lines
##### Non-parallel lines
- One solutions
##### Distinct parallel lines 
Parallel lines that are not the same lines 
- Zero solutions
##### Coincident parallel lines
Literally the same lines
- Infinite solutions
### Procdures
- Solve linear equations
- Interpret

### Examples
