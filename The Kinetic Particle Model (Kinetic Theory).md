## Assumptions
- All matter is made up of tiny particles
- Particles are in constant motion
- No kinetic energy is lost or gained in particle collisions
- There are forces of attraction and repulsion between the particles
- The distance between the particles in a gas are large compared to the size of the particles



These assumptions apply to all states of matter. Solids, liquids, gasses and plasma




### Solids
- Matter is held in fixed shape because they exert forces on each other.
- Particles are evenly spread
- Forces are balanced'
- Don't really move around
- [[Kinetic Particle Model SOLIDS]]



### Liquids
- Remain in fixed volume
- No fixed shape
- Usually larger volume than solids
- [[Kinetic Particle Model LIQUIDS]]



### Gasses
- Very high particle speeds
- No fixed volume
- Forces are not strong enough to keep gas together
- [[Kinetic Particle Model GASSES]]


### Plasms
- Particles are so hot that they become ionized (electrons free from atoms)
- Giant glump of positive and negative charges
