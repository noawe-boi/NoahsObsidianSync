### What is the strength of an acid?
The strength of an acid is given by its degree of ionisation (or dissociation) in an aqueous solution

#### The strength of strong acids
Usually we don't bother finding the $K_a$ of a strong acid, as we assume that $[A]=[H^+]$. i.e) The acid completely dissociates

### How do you determine the strength of an acid?
#### The general ionisation equation
$HA + H_2O \rightleftharpoons H_3O + A^-$ 

Where
- $A^-$ is a conjugate base
- $HA$ represents an acid that dissociates into $A^-$  **and** a hydronium ion ($H_3O$)

Clearly in this case
- $H_2O$ and $H_3O$ are conjugate base and acid pairs
- $HA$ and $A^-$ are conjugate base and acid pairs
#### Acid dissociation constant ($K_a$)
$$K_a=\frac{[H_3O^+][A^-]}{[HA][H_2O]}$$
**However**, we let $[H_2O]=1$. 
Therefore:
$$K_a=\frac{[H_3O^+][A^-]}{[HA]}$$

Where
- $A^-$ is a conjugate base
- $HA$ represents an acid that dissociates into $A^-$  **and** a hydronium ion ($H_3O$)


We are basically just measuring the ratio of undissociated-to-dissociated acid. 
- Bigger $K_a$ shows that there is more dissociated than undissociated.
- Smaller $K_a$ shows that there is more undissociated than dissociated. 
#### Interpreting $K_a$ 
##### Weak acids
$K_a<1$
##### Strong acids
$K_a>1$
