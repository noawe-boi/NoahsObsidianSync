### Claim
Electromagnetic radiation around the home, such as inductive chargers or WiFi, is dangerous to human health.



### Background

EMF spectrum: part about how light is emf

What kinds of EMF is harmful??
Ionizing vs non ionizing radiation: 

EMF with very short wavelengths are considered to have higher energy than EMF with larger wavelengths. (https://www.healthline.com/health/emf#types). EMF waves that carry enough energy can be considered 'Ionizing'.  This means that they have enough energy remove electrons from atoms. 
While ionizing radiation is confirmed to be harmful to human health, the only types of EMF that have enough energy to do this are alpha, beta, gamma and X-rays. It should also be mentioned that while these types of radiation are harmful, vary


What types of radiation do devices such as inductive chargers or Wi-Fi emit?
