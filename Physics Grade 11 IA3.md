### Claim
Electromagnetic radiation around the home, such as inductive chargers or WiFi, is dangerous to human health.

<<<<<<< HEAD
This claim is very broad, as it does not specify petroleum exclusively as a substance that electromagnetic radiation could ignite. Additionally, the before it can be found whether Electromagnetic Radiation (EMF) emitted from phones has the ability to ignite flammable materials, the nature of the waves that phones could possible emit must be found.

### Background

#### What kinds of EMR do these devices emit. 

The term 'Electromagnetic Radiation' covers an entire spectrum, not all of which is harmful to human health. For example, waves between wavelengths 380 to 700 nanometers (https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/) are what make up the visible spectrum of light, in which we are constantly absorbing every day. 

##### Risk from ultraviolet radiation exposure

#### Ionizing vs non ionizing radiation.
