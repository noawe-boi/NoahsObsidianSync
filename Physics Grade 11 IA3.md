### Claim
Electromagnetic radiation around the home, such as inductive chargers or WiFi, is dangerous to human health.



### Background`


What is EMF

What are these devices and why do these devices emit EMF?

Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi )is a wireless communication and networking system that encodes information into radio waves to provide internet access to devices such as phones or computers. 


What kinds of EMF is harmful??

EMF spectrum: part about how light is emf

The term 'Electromagnetic Radiation' covers an entire spectrum, *not all of which is harmful to human health* ***maybe instead make the research question about whether any forms of radiation are harmful to human health??***

. For example, waves between wavelengths 380 to 700 nanometers (https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/) are what make up the visible spectrum of light, in which we are constantly absorbing every day. 

Ionizing vs non ionizing radiation: 

EMF with very short wavelengths are considered to have higher energy than EMF with larger wavelengths. (https://www.healthline.com/health/emf#types). EMF waves that carry enough energy can be considered 'Ionizing'.  This means that they have enough energy remove electrons from atoms. 
While ionizing radiation is confirmed to be harmful to human health, the only types of EMF that have enough energy to do this are alpha, beta, gamma and X-rays. It should also be mentioned that while these types of radiation are harmful, they are only harmful with sufficient exposure.
