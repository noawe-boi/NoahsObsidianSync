### Claim
"Electromagnetic Radiation from mobile phones can 
ignite flammable materials such as petroleum"

This claim is very broad, as it does not specify petroleum exclusively as a substance that electromagnetic radiation could ignite. Additionally, the before it can be found whether Electromagnetic Radiation (EMF) emitted from phones has the ability to ignite flammable materials, the nature of the waves that phones could possible emit must be found.



`Cell phones emit radiation in the radiofrequency region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Second-, third-, and fourth-generation cell phones (2G, 3G, 4G) emit radiofrequency in the frequency range of 0.7â€“2.7 GHz. Fifth-generation (5G) cell phones are anticipated to use the frequency spectrum up to 80 GHz.`

### Research Question:
Can EMF *within spectrum and intensity that phones can emit* cause ignition
