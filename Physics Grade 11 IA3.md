### Claim
Electromagnetic radiation around the home, such as inductive chargers or WiFi, is dangerous to human health.

### Background

#### What kinds of EMR do these devices emit. 

The term 'Electromagnetic Radiation' covers an entire spectrum, not all of which is harmful to human health. For example, waves between wavelengths 380 to 700 nanometers (https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/) are what make up the visible spectrum of light, in which we are constantly absorbing every day. 

##### Risk from ultraviolet radiation exposure

#### Ionizing vs non ionizing radiation.
