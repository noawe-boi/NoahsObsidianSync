## Introduction
### Claim
Electromagnetic radiation around the home, such as inductive chargers or Wi-Fi, is dangerous to human health.

### Rationale


### Background`




### Scientific Concepts
#### EMFs and Electromagnetic Radiation
Electromagnetic Radiation, Electromagnetic waves, or EMFs, are all terms used to describe the transmission of energy through waves called photons (NASA, 2013).

Photons have no mass and are generated when electrons or other charged particles are excited enough to change energy levels. Particles emit photons when this change in energy level occurs. EMFs are not a single type of wave but an entire spectrum, not all of which is harmful to human health. For example, waves between wavelengths 380 to 700 nanometers (NASA, 2010) make up the visible spectrum of light, which people constantly absorb every day.

#### Ionising vs Non-ionising Radiation

Since $E=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$, when $hc$ remians constant, smaller wavelengths will cause the wave to have higher energy.Since EMFs with shorter wavelengths carry more energy than EMFs with larger wavelengths at the same amplitude (Cirino & Lamoreux, 2018). EMFs that carry enough energy, usually those with incredibly small wavelengths, become 'Ionising.' This means that they have enough energy to remove electrons from atoms, or 'ionise' them. Ionising radiation can be in the form of alpha, beta, gamma, or X-rays, with alpha having the least amount of energy and potential to penetrate barriers, and gamma having the highest (CDC, 2024). Lower frequency waves can also ionise if they carry enough energy.

Ionising radiation's ability to ionise poses a high risk to DNA and cells within the body. Doses in excess of 100mSv have been linked to the development of cancer (WHO, 2023), and intense doses can destroy DNA, making it impossible for cells to reproduce. 

Non-ionising radiation cannot directly alter DNA but can pose a risk to the body. For example, microwaves are a common household appliance that most commonly operates at 2.45GHz. This frequency's wavelength causes polarised water molecules to rapidly rotate and create friction between each other, which then creates heat. This heating could cause burns (Clark, 2022), brain injury, cell oxidative stress, genetic damage and impairment of the body's cells (Rahman, 2018). Additionally, the World Health Organisation has classified non-ionising radiation between the frequencies of 30kHz to 300GHz as Group 2B carcinogens, meaning that they have the potential to cause cancer in humans (Lohnes, 2022).

#### Why do these devices emit EMF and at what frequencies

Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) is a wireless communication and networking system that encodes information into radio waves to provide internet access to devices such as phones or computers. By design, it creates significant EMFs between the frequencies 2GHz and 6GHz (Lohnes, 2017). The Wireless Power Consortium's 'Qi' is a set of specifications, or standards, that nearly every phone equipped with wireless charging adheres to. The Qi charging standard utilises frequencies between 87kHz and 207kHz. Other, lower-power devices may use inductively coupled wireless charging, which relies on, and operates using, the 50Hz to 60Hz oscillation of the AC power it is supplied from the grid. While these devices create EMFs, any other appliances running on grid power will also create the same fields via the flow of current in house wiring (Lohnes, 2022).

#### At what amplitude do these devices emit EMFs

Regulations in Australia limit the power that devices that utilise Wi-Fi can emit to 30dBm (ACMA, n.d.) or ~1 Watt (Clark, 2022). The Qi Charging standard can transmit a maximum of 15 Watts (The Ultimate Guide to Wireless Charging, 2022).

### Research Question

Are Electromagnetic Fields between 2GHz-6GHz and 87kHz-205kHz, at 1 Watt and 15 Watt transmit powers respectively, harmful to human health?


## Evidence

##### Identification of patterns/analysis

Figure 1 shows conductivity and skin depth penetration of waves at frequencies ranging from 150MHz to 10GHz in different types of tissues. EMFs at these frequencies do not possess enough energy to ionise, however, as stated previously, they still have the ability to cause harm. 
The more conduction and penetration through tissue is possible, the higher the absorption and potential for damage in said tissue. 

It can be observed that as the frequency of the wave increases, the conductivity, or S/m value, increases, while penetration, or the $\delta$/mm value, decreases. This inverse relationship could suggest that higher frequencies are more readily absorbed at the surface of the skin, resulting in reduced penetration. 

In addition to increase conductivity the impact of higher energy waves could be increased since higher frequency waves also contain more energy than lower frequency waves with the same amplitude. 

It should also be mentioned that tissues containing higher water content, such as skin and muscle, have the highest conductivity at all frequencies.






**Effect of this??**

This trend suggests that while the frequencies associated with Wi-Fi have the potential to be absorbed by and affect the body, frequencies emitted by Qi wireless chargers between 87kHz and 205kHz may not have enough energy or have too large of a wavelength to affect cells to the same degree.





##### Limitations

- No way to correlate these values with quantity of exposure
- No effects of this conductivity listed in paper
- conductivity not quantified against absorption

##### Identification of patterns/analysis
The study *'Single- and double-strand DNA breaks in rat brain cells after acute exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic radiation'*, conducted by Taylor & Francis Ltd (1996), aimed to investigate the effects of continuous exposure to 2450MHz (2.45GHz) EMFs on the DNA strand lengths in rat brain cells at an average-specific absorption rate of 1.2W/Kg. 
Rats were exposed to an environment with a density of Electromagnetic Radiation of 1mW/cm$^2$ at 2.45GHz for 2 hours 

It was hypothesised that 2.45GHz EMFs emitted from cellular devices, such as phones, were similar enough to those used in industrial processing and in microwaves to cause harm to cells. 


This investigation revealed that the rats exposed to EMFs had significantly more DNA breaks when compared to the control group, or 'SHAM'. This type damage to DNA is known to cause cell death, cancer or neurodegenerative disease. 

![[Pasted image 20240728172202.png]]
Figure 2 

Figure 2 plots the frequency distribution of single strand lengths against the percentage abundance in both EMF exposed, and SHAM rats.


The paper suggests that the effects of the EMFs on brain cell DNA were directly caused by interaction with the EMFs, as opposed to the result of absorption in other parts of the body. In addition, the paper further implies that the presence of DNA strand breaks remaining long enough after exposure to be measured may suggest that EMFs not only caused this damage, but impaired brain cells ability to repair it. 


##### Limitations
- While Observable damage was observed to have occurred in rat brain cells due to their exposure to 2.45Ghz EMFs, the power of waves used in this experiment and the total average-specific absorption is 1.2W/Kg. This is much larger than what could be emitted by consumer Wi-Fi devices, as they are limited to a transmit power of 1 Watt. Furthermore, only a portion of this energy will be absorbed by nearby cells. It is unclear what effects these lower doses could result in. 
- Another factor that limits the reliability of this study is difference in rat brain cells when compared to humans. While they are similar, the differences in how EMFs effect human brain cells cannot be known for certain unless further investigation is conducted.

The study "The Biocompatibility of Wireless Power Charging System on Human Neural Cells", by Skovierova et al. (2021), the effects of 87kHz EMFs on various healthy (HA and T98G), and cancerous (SH-SY5Y) human cells. Cells were exposed to 87kHz fields for 30 minutes at strengths varying from 0.3mT to 1.2mT based on their location. This exposure is 11-44 times larger than International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) standards condone as safe. The percentage of dead, early apoptotic, and late apoptotic cells were recorded. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a pre-programmed self-destruct sequence that cells execute when they detect that they are abnormal or unneeded.

##### Identification of patterns/analysis
Figure 2 presents the location and percentage of cells in various states. In all cell types there appears to be no correlation between the location of the cells and the percentage of cells in each state. In the case of the T98G cells, the percent of dead cells at the end of trials only varied by $\pm$ 0.1% in comparison to the control group. The percentage of dead cells in these trials also increased in different proportion across all trials. The same can be said about the rates of Early and late apoptosis.


##### Limitations

While this study did show the effects of short term, high intensity, exposure, the effects of chronic exposure may differ. Aditioanlly, long term exposure to smaller intensities would more closley resemble the actual use case of wireless chargers. While the cells used in these trials are human, further investigation may be required to fully understand the effects on cells that transmit electrical signals, such as neurons. Finally, it cannot be known what amounts of EMF or these cells were exposed to before these trials occurred. It must be assumed that the effects of previous exposure are negligible.
