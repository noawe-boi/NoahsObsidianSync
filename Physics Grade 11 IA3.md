## Introduction
### Claim
Electromagnetic radiation around the home, such as inductive chargers or Wi-Fi, is dangerous to human health.

### Rationale

### Background`




### Scientific Concepts
#### EMFs and Electromagnetic Radiation
Electromagnetic Radiation, Electromagnetic waves, or EMFs, are all terms used to describe the transmission of energy through waves called photons (NASA, 2013).

Photons have no mass and are generated when electrons or other charged particles are excited enough to change energy levels. Particles emit photons when this change in energy level occurs. EMFs are not a single type of wave but an entire spectrum, not all of which is harmful to human health. For example, waves between wavelengths 380 to 700 nanometers (NASA, 2010) make up the visible spectrum of light, which people constantly absorb every day.

#### Ionising vs Non-ionising Radiation

EMFs with shorter wavelengths are known to carry more energy than EMFs with larger wavelengths at the same amplitude (Cirino & Lamoreux, 2018). EMFs that carry enough energy, usually those with incredibly small wavelengths, become 'Ionising.' This means that they have enough energy to remove electrons from atoms, or 'ionise' them. Ionising radiation can be in the form of alpha, beta, gamma, or X-rays, with alpha having the least amount of energy and potential to penetrate barriers, and gamma having the highest (CDC, 2024). Lower frequency waves can also ionise if they carry enough energy.

Ionising radiation's ability to ionise poses a high risk to DNA and cells within the body. Doses in excess of 100mSv have been linked to the development of cancer (WHO, 2023), and intense doses can destroy DNA, making it impossible for cells to reproduce. 

Non-ionising radiation cannot directly alter DNA but can pose a risk to the body. For example, microwaves are a common household appliance that most commonly operates at 2.45GHz. This frequency's wavelength causes polarised water molecules to rapidly rotate and create friction between each other, which then creates heat. This heating could cause burns (Clark, 2022), brain injury, cell oxidative stress, genetic damage and impairment of the body's cells (Rahman, 2018). Additionally, the World Health Organisation has classified non-ionising radiation between the frequencies of 30kHz to 300GHz as Group 2B carcinogens, meaning that they have the potential to cause cancer in humans (Lohnes, 2022).

#### Why do these devices emit EMF and at what frequencies

Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) is a wireless communication and networking system that encodes information into radio waves to provide internet access to devices such as phones or computers. By design, it creates significant EMFs between the frequencies 2GHz and 6GHz (Lohnes, 2017). The Wireless Power Consortium's 'Qi' is a set of specifications, or standards, that nearly every phone equipped with wireless charging adheres to. The Qi charging standard utilises frequencies between 87kHz and 207kHz. Other, lower-power devices may use inductively coupled wireless charging, which relies on, and operates using, the 50Hz to 60Hz oscillation of the AC power it is supplied from the grid. While these devices create EMFs, any other appliances running on grid power will also create the same fields via the flow of current in house wiring (Lohnes, 2022).

#### At what amplitude do these devices emit EMFs

Regulations in Australia limit the power that devices that utilise Wi-Fi can emit to 30dBm (ACMA, n.d.) or ~1 Watt (Clark, 2022). The Qi Charging standard can transmit a maximum of 15 Watts (The Ultimate Guide to Wireless Charging, 2022).

### Research Question

Are Electromagnetic Fields between 2GHz-6GHz and 87kHz-205kHz, at 1 Watt and 15 Watt transmit powers respectively, harmful to human health?

##### Identification of patterns/analysis

Figure 1 shows conductivity and skin depth penetration of waves at frequencies ranging from 150MHz to 10GHz in different types of tissues. EMFs at these frequencies do not possess enough energy to ionise, however, as stated previously, they still have the ability to cause harm. 
The more conduction and penetration through tissue is possible, the higher the absorption and potential for damage in said tissue. 

It can be observed that as the frequency of the wave increases, the conductivity, or S/m value, increases, while penetration, or the $\delta$/mm value, decreases. This inverse relationship could suggest that higher frequencies are more readily absorbed at the surface of the skin, resulting in reduced penetration. Since higher frequency waves also contain more energy than lower frequency waves with the same amplitude, higher frequency waves that are already potnetially absorbed more readily could 

**effect of this??**

In addition to this, tissues containing higher water content, such as skin and muscle, have the highest conductivity at all frequencies.

The study *'Single- and double-strand DNA breaks in rat brain cells after acute exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic radiation'*, conducted by Taylor & Francis Ltd (1996), aimed to investigate the effects of continuous exposure to 2450MHz (2.45GHz) EMFs on the DNA strand lengths in rat brain cells at an average-specific absorption rate of 1.2W/Kg. 
Rats were exposed to an environment with a density of Electromagnetic Radiation of 1mW/cm$^2$ at 2.45GHz for 2 hours 

It was hypothesised that 2.45GHz EMFs emitted from cellular devices, such as phones, were similar enough to those used in industrial processing and in microwaves to cause harm to cells. 


This investigation revealed that the rats exposed to EMFs had significantly more DNA breaks when compared to the control group, or 'SHAM'. This type damage to DNA is known to cause cell death, cancer or neurodegenerative disease.

Figure 2 

Figure 2 plots the frequency distribution of single strand lengths against the percentage abundance in both EMF exposed, and SHAM rats.


The paper suggests that the effects of the EMFs on brain cell DNA was a direct effect of the EMFs, as opposed to the result of absorption in other parts of the body. In addition, the paper further implies that the presence of DNA strand breaks remaining long enough after exposure to be measured may suggest that EMFs not only caused this damage, but impaired brain cells ability to repair it. 

While Observable damage was observed to have occurred in rat brain cells due to their exposure to 2.45Ghz EMFs, the power of waves used in this experiment and the total average-specific absorption is much larger than what could be emitted by consumer Wi-Fi devices.\
