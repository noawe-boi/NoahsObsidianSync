The air was cool and dry, and the walls an off white, as if someone had been smoking in proximity to them for a while. On the roof, above the fake wooden floor, there was a single plastic grated panel. It's one job was to ventilate the room, however it had been blocked since the house was sold. Left of the doorway was a handmade table, about as big as a door mat, left of that there was a filing cabinet, and left of that a larger desk a few meters in length that spanned nearly half of the left wall. Not an inch of its tarnished and uneven surface was unobstructed by the assortment of screens, j into position like mold that always grew back. The back wall had a bed against it, the resting place for the rooms single inhabitant. 



I once heard someone ask whether a bee can fly when its wings are so small but its body so fat. Right now, in the presence of my own reflection, I wonder how I stand, with my head being so much larger than my body. What kind of genetics did my parents give me? or maybe fail to pass on...
What went wrong in my mothers lovin' oven for me to come out with only a single hair on my head, longer than my nose. My nose is another thing. Its right between my eyes, bigger than either one of them too. It can really brighten someone's day when you smile at them, and my smile is pretty hard to miss. My mouth stretches across almost the entirety of the lower third of my face and might be the only thing that is actually in proportion to my head. Other than my perfectly circular head, the rest of me is mostly in proportion with a triangle. I usually wear a yellow shirt with horizontal black stripes, the rest of my clothes have to be tailored to fit my build. My legs are short but otherwise unremarkable. attached to them are my feet, which are flat but, nothing some orthopedic insoles can't remedy. Who am I? Charlie brown!
