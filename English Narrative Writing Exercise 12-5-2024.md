The air was cool and dry, and the walls an off white, as if someone had been smoking in proximity to them for a while. On the roof, above the fake wooden floor, there was a single plastic grated panel. It's one job was to ventilate the room, however it had been blocked since the house was sold. Left of the doorway was a handmade table, about as big as a door mat, left of that there was a filing cabinet, and left of that a larger desk a few meters in length that spanned nearly half of the left wall. Not an inch of its tarnished and uneven surface was unobstructed by the assortment of screens, j into position like mold that always grew back. The back wall had a bed against it, the resting place for the rooms single inhabitant. 



I once heard someone ask whether a bee can fly when its wings are so small but its body so fat. Right now, in the presence of my own reflection, I wonder how I stand, with my head being so much larger than my body.
