#physics 
- Sound is a vibration
- Sound travels as a longitudinal wave 
![[Excalidraw/Longitudinal waves]]
Note: soundwaves are often represented as transverse waves for simplicity.  
![[longitunindal transverse wave]]


### Speed of Sound
- The stiffer the material, the faster sound waves/vibrations travel through it
![[physics example 10.1.1]]
### Harmonics
- A harmonic is a combination of multiple frequencies
- The smallest (lowest frequency) produced by a pipe of string is called 'fundamental frequency'
