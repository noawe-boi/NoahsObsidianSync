#### Standard Deviation
$s.d.= \sigma = \sqrt{\textrm{Var}(X)}$
$\sigma = \sqrt{ \hat{p}(1-\hat{p} / n )}$

### Vocab and definitions
#### Point estimate
![[Point Estimate]]
#### Interval Estimate
![[Interval estimate]]
#### Common $z$ values
![[Common z values]]

#### Approximate confidence intervals for $p$
An approximate $C\%$ confidence interval for $p$ is given by
$(\hat{p} - z \sqrt{ \hat{p}(1-\hat{p} / n}, \hat{p} + z \sqrt{ \hat{p}(1-\hat{p} / n})$
Where:
- $p$ is the unknown population proportion
- $\hat p$ is the value of the sample proportion
- $n$ is the size of the sample
- $z$ is such that $Pr(-z<Z<z)=C\%$ 
#### Distance between sample estimate
Distance between sample estimate and the endpoints of the confidence interval is call margin of error:
- $E=z\sqrt{\hat p (\frac{1-\hat p}{n})}$
#### Required $C\%$ confidence for sample size
$n=\frac{z}{E}^2 \cdot p^*(1-p^*)$
Where:
- $p^*$ is an estimated value for the population proportion ($p$)
