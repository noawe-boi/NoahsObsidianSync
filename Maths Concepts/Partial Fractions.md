### Rules
#### Linear factors
For every linear factor $ax+b$, in the denominator there will be a partial fraction in the form of $\frac{A}{ax+b}$ 
	for every $ax+b$ factor, there will be something else over $ax+b$
#### Repeated linear factors 
For every repeated linear factor $(cd+d)^2$, in the denominator, there will be a partial fraction in the form of $\frac{B}{cx+d}+\frac{C}{(cx+d)^2}$  
#### Irreducible quadratic
For every [[irreducible quadratic]] factor, $ax^2+bx+c$, in the denominator there will be a partial fraction of the form $\frac{Dx+E}{ax^2 + b + c}$.
