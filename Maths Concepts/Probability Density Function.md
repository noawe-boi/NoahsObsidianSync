### Background
#### For a continuously random variable
- $f(x)\geq 0, \forall x$ 
	$f(x)$ is greater or equal to 0 for all $x$ values
- $\int ^ \infty _{-\infty}f(x)\textrm{dx}=1$
	For a function that describes the probability of an event happening, the area under the curve must always be 1. Like how $\Sigma p(x)=1$
		i.e. Total area under the curve is $1$

### For a probability density function (PDF)
The probability of a set of values occurring is the area underneath the curve between these $x$-values. 
$$
\begin{align}
\textrm{if X is a continiously random}&\textrm{ variable, with density function }f\\
Pr(Aa<X<b)=&\int^b_af(x) dx

\end{align}
$$
