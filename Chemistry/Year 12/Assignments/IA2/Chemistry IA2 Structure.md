### Introduction

#### Rationale 
What is a redox reaction
What is a galvanic cell
What is a half cell
	Components of a half cell
How does this come together (How are half cells connected in the setup)
	What is the result of this 
	Why does this happen

Original experiment
	Chemical equation of redox 

What affects voltage

Find an equation to predict voltage. 

what is the predicted relationship
#### Research question
*Therefore* my research question will be
The effect of changing *THIS* on **THAT**

### Method
#### Modifications
#### Risk assessment

### Results
#### Raw data 
Table form

#### Processing of data
Sample equation

#### Actual processed data
##### Graph(s)
##### Processed data

### Trends patterns and relationships

What do the figures tell us. 
How does this relate to the expected relationship

### Uncertainty and limitations
