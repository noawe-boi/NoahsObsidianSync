	\section{Rationale}
	
	
	\subsection{Background}

	

	\textbf{Redox}
	
	Redox reactions are reactions that involve the transfer of electrons between atoms. These reactions commonly occur within galvanic cells, which within themselves contain two half cells. 
	

	\textbf{Half Cells}
	
	Half cells consists of an electrolyte solution and electrode. When two half cells are connected through a load, and a salt  bridge, one of these half cells will become the anode, where oxidation occurs, and the other will become the cathode, where reduction occurs. The oxidised cell will transfer its electrons across a wire, where they will then reach and be accepted by the reduced cell.
	
	Each half cell has its own standard electrode potential ($E^0$) which dictates the magnitude of electron emission, or attraction it has under standard lab conditions. 
	
	By measuring the difference in magnitude between half cells, the overall potential between the cells can be quantified. 
	
	$$
	E^0_{\textrm{ Cell}}=E^0_{\textrm{ Cathode}}-E^0_{\textrm{ Anode}}
	$$
	
	For this experiment, the half cells will be made up of zinc and copper, which have $E^0$ values of $-0.7618$V, and $+0.3419$V respectively. Cell's with this composition are also known as "Daniel Cells", and will have a theoretical voltage, under standard conditions, of: $$(0.3419-(-0.7618))=1.1037\textrm{V}$$
	
	

	\textbf{The Nernst Equation}\newline
	The Nernst equation is a mathematical equation that allows the theoretical voltage potential of a cell to be quantified under non-standard conditions. While factors such as temperature and pressure throughout the experiment were not modified, the reaction quotient $(Q)$ was indirectly altered by the change in $[CuSO_4]$. 
\newline The Nernst equation is defined as:
	$$
	E_{\textrm{cell}}=E^0 - \frac{RT}{nF}\cdot \ln(Q)
	$$
	Where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $E$ = Theoretical electrode potential (voltage)of the cell
		\item $E^0$ = Standard electrode potential of the cell
		\item $T$ = Temperature in kelvin 
		\item $R$ = Universal gas constant
		\item $F$= Faraday constant
		\item $z$ = Number of moles of electrons transferred
		\item $Q$ = Reaction Quotient
		

	\end{itemize}
Substituting 
\begin{align*}
E_{\textrm{cell}}=(0.3419+0.7618)-\frac{8.31446261815324\cdot298}{2\cdot96485}&\cdot\ln\frac{[Zn^{2+}]}{[Cu^{2+}]}\\
E_{\textrm{cell}}=(0.3419+0.7618)-\frac{8.31446261815324\cdot298}{2\cdot96485}&\cdot\ln\frac{1}{[Cu^{2+}]} \because [Zn^{2+}]\textrm{ remains constant}
\end{align*}

		\caption{The theoretical relationship between $E_{\textrm{cell}}$ and $[Cu^{2+}]$}
		\label{ogLog}
\end{figure}
\newpage
Considering Figure \ref{ogLog}, the theoretical change in $E_\textrm{cell}$ is minuscule in comparison to the change in $[Cu^{2+}]$. When the $x$-axis increases from 0.5 to 1, a change of only $0.009$V is observed. If the relationship is further considered, with domain [0.5, 2], increasing concentration by a factor of 4 only results in an an additional $0.018$V. It was questioned whether this relationship held true, especially as $\lim\limits_{x\to 0}$.

Investigation of $[Cu^{2+}]=(0, 1]$ would theoretically be the most distinguishable from a logarithmic relationship if the observed relationship diverges due to the distinct curve observed in the area. 

Clearly $[Zn^{2+}]=[Cu^{2+}]\neq 0$, as this would either result in a division by 0, or $\ln(0)$, which are both undefined. 
\subsection{Research Question}
How does altering $[CuSO_4]$ at low concentrations (0-1 mol) affect its voltage output, and does the observed relationship follow the theoretical relationship when applying the Nernst equation.
\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Modifications}

The following modifications were made to the original experiment. The original method can be found in the appendix section.\newline
\textbf{Half Cell Compositions}\newline
The results of original experiment indicated that copper and aluminium produced the largest voltage. It was theorised that after multiple trials, the aluminium would oxidise, skewing results.

It was decided that copper and zinc would be more suitable as although they produced a smaller voltage, zinc would take longer to oxidise and therefore producer more consistent results.

\textbf{Electrodes}\newline
Rather than thin strips, larger plates were bent into a "C" shape, slightly smaller than the diameter of the beaker they would be placed in. This maximised the surface area in contact with the electrolyte solution. Furthermore by reusing the same electrodes, this surface area was constant for all trials.

\textbf{Measurement devices}\newline
A digital multimeter was substituted in place of the conventional analog volt meter. Since the digital multimeter uses digital logic to measure voltage, rather than a magnetic field induced by the flow of current, the digital multimeter should reduce the ions 'used up' during each measurement. Furthermore the digital output measures volts to 3 decimal places, leading to reduced uncertainty and increased precision. 

\textbf{Salt Bridge}\newline
The salt bridge was unaltered, and still made from filter paper, however, care was taken to ensure consistency in their size.

\textbf{Procedure}\newline
The electrolyte solutions were pre-mixed, labelled, and stored in sealed containers prior to the start of the experiment. This reduced the potential for errors in procedure, as well as the time it took to conduct the experiment, which reduced the influence of environmental factors, such as changes in temperature, on results.

\subsection{Method}
\textbf{Materials}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 30ml $CuSO_4$ at concentrations $1.00\textrm{M}, 0.85\textrm{M}, 0.70\textrm{M}, 0.55\textrm{M}, 0.40\textrm{M}, 0.30\textrm{M}, 0.20\textrm{M}, 0.10\textrm{M}$
	\item 240ml $1$M$\;ZnSO_4$
	\item 20ml $KNO_3$
	\item Petri dish
	\item $50\textrm{ml}$ Beaker - x$2$
	\item Zinc sheet $\approx4\textrm{cm}\times6\textrm{cm}$ 
	\item Copper sheet $\approx4\textrm{cm}\times6\textrm{cm}$ 
	\item Emery paper
	\item Filter paper strips $\approx 2\textrm{cm}\times10\textrm{cm}$
	\item Digital Multimeter
	\item Alligator clips
	\item 150ml Plastic bottle - x16
	\item Tweezers 
	\item 1L Distilled water
	\item Emery paper
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Procedure}
\small
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Pour varying amounts of $CUSO_4$ into 150ml plastic bottles and dilute with distilled water to form solutions with concentrations $1.00\textrm{M}, 0.85\textrm{M}, 0.70\textrm{M}, 0.55\textrm{M}, 0.40\textrm{M}, 0.30\textrm{M}, 0.20\textrm{M and } 0.10\textrm{M}$.
	
	\item Fill 8 of the 150ml plastic bottles with 30ml of 1M $ZnSO_4$ and set aside with copper solutions. 
	
	\item Polish electrodes with emery paper until they their entire surface is free of visible oxidation then connect to alligator clips.
	
	\item Connect alligator clips to multimeter and set to DC voltage mode.
	
	\item Transfer the contents of a $CUSO_4$, and $ZnSO_4$ container into separate beakers.
	
	\item Wet salt bridge with $KNO_3$ and rest over the lip of both beakers, so that it is partially submerged in both. 
	
	\item Add the electrodes to the solution and record result as soon as value settles.
	
	\item Remove electrodes immediately and wash with distilled water. Stir electrolyte solutions with a glass stir rod. Remove salt bridge and dispose of.
	
	\item Reconstruct cell with a new salt bridge, add electrodes back, and repeat measurementation so that there are three trials in total for any given concentration.
	
	\item Safely dispose of electrolyte solutions, wash equipment, and repeat for next $CUSO_4$ concentration.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Risk assessment}
While the electrolytes utilised in this experiment are considered to be harmful if ingested or applied to a persons eyes, there is no risk of injury via inhalation or accidental skin contact as long as appropriate action is taken (ventilation, washing affected area). PPE was worn by all participants to protect their eyes (Lab goggles), body (lab coat) and hands (nitrite gloves). The electrolyte materials are also considered environmental hazards ($CuSO_4, ZnSO_4$), however since the quantities used were so low, they could safely be disposed of in the sink with after dilution.
\textit{For other risks or more details, see risk assessment table attached as an appendix.}

\subsection{Analysis of Evidence}
The scatter plot produced using experimental data suggests a linear relationship. Using desmos, linear and logarithmic and linear lines of best fit were found.





Theory would suggest it should be logarithmic

\label{lowingVoltage}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{lowingVoltage} depicts a trend observed where as trials continued, the voltage of each subsequent trial decreased slightly. Procedure was considered and it was theorised that this was due to reuse of the same electrolyte solution over multiple trials. The number of ions left on solution likely decreased as measurements were taken and and differed due to inconsistent duration of the measurement phase. This was theorised to have lead to a smaller voltage. To accurately consider this trend, and evaluate the reliability of the relationship, the average of all data points against what `trial' they were collected during was considered. While the change in voltage is only on average $-0.02$V per trial, considering $R^2=0.9922$, the linear regression indicates a very high correlation. However due to the large range of values considered, the uncertainty in this relationship is so high that the minimum trendline has a positive gradient, therefore further investigation is required to confirm this. 






\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Improvements}
Sources of error/improvements

\begin{itemize}
	\item Alligator clips in solution (floating voltage)
	\item Inconsistent measurement time. (outlier is main case of this).
	\item Alligator clips sitting in electrolyte during experiment.
	\item Temperature and pressure unknown on day of experimentation. This means that the nerenst equation cannot account for them. Therefore difference in between Nernst equation and actual results n
\end{itemize}
