	\section{Rationale}
	
	
	\subsection{Background}

	

	\textbf{Redox}
	
	Redox reactions are reactions that involve the transfer of electrons between atoms. These reactions commonly occur within galvanic cells, which within themselves contain two half cells. 
	

	\textbf{Half Cells}
	
	Half cells consists of an electrolyte solution and electrode. When two are connected through a load and a salt  bridge, one of these half cells will become the anode, where oxidation occurs, and the other will become the cathode, where reduction occurs.
	
	The oxidised cell will transfer its electrons across a wire, where they will then reach and be accepted by the reduced cell.
	
	Each cell has its own standard electrode potential ($E^0$) which dictates the magnitude of electron emission, or attraction it has under standard lab conditions. 
	
	By measuring the difference in magnitude between cells, the overall potential between the cells can be quantified. 
	
	$$
	E^0_{\textrm{ Cell}}=E^0_{\textrm{ Cathode}}-E^0_{\textrm{ Anode}}
	$$
	
	
	
	\textbf{todo}\newline
	What is the result of this?
	
	Why does this happen


	\textbf{The Nernst Equation}\newline
	The Nernst equation is a mathematical equation that allows the theoretical voltage potential of a cell under varying temperatures and concentrations to be quantified.
	
	$$
	E=E^0 - \frac{RT}{nF}\cdot \ln(Q)
	$$
	Where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $E$ = Theoretical electrode potential (voltage)of the cell
		\item $E^0$ = Standard electrode potential of the cell
		\item $T$ = Temperature in kelvin 
		\item $R$ = Universal gas constant
		\item $F$= Faraday constant
		\item $z$ = Number of moles of electrons transferred
		\item $Q$ = Reaction Quotient
		
	\end{itemize}
\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Modifications}

The following modifications were made to the original experiment. The original method can be found in the appendix section.\newline
\textbf{Half Cell Compositions}\newline
The results of original experiment indicated that copper and aluminium produced the largest voltage. It was theorised that after multiple trials, the aluminium would oxidise, skewing results.

It was decided that copper and zinc would be more suitable as although they produced a smaller voltage, zinc would take longer to oxidise and therefore producer more consistent results.

\textbf{Electrodes}\newline
Rather than thin strips, larger plates were bent into a "C" shape, slightly smaller than the diameter of the beaker they would be placed in. This maximised the surface area in contact with the electrolyte solution. Furthermore by reusing the same electrodes, this surface area was constant for all trials.

\textbf{Measurement devices}\newline
A digital multimeter was substituted in place of the conventional analog volt meter. Since the digital multimeter uses digital logic to measure voltage, rather than a magnetic field induced by the flow of current, the digital multimeter should reduce the ions 'used up' during each measurement. Furthermore the digital output measures volts to 3 decimal places, leading to reduced uncertainty and increased precision. 

\textbf{Salt Bridge}\newline
The salt bridge was unaltered, and still made from filter paper, however, care was taken to ensure consistency in their size.

\textbf{Procedure}\newline
The electrolyte solutions were pre-mixed, labelled, and stored in sealed containers prior to the start of the experiment. This reduced the potential for errors in procedure, as well as the time it took to conduct the experiment, which reduced the influence of environmental factors, such as changes in temperature, on results.

\subsection{Method}
\textbf{Materials}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 30ml $CuSO_4$ at concentrations $1.00\textrm{M}, 0.85\textrm{M}, 0.70\textrm{M}, 0.55\textrm{M}, 0.40\textrm{M}, 0.30\textrm{M}, 0.20\textrm{M}, 0.10\textrm{M}$
	\item 240ml $1$M$\;ZnSO_4$
	\item 20ml $KNO_3$
	\item Petri dish
	\item $50\textrm{ml}$ Beaker - x$2$
	\item Zinc sheet $\approx4\textrm{cm}\times6\textrm{cm}$ 
	\item Copper sheet $\approx4\textrm{cm}\times6\textrm{cm}$ 
	\item Emery paper
	\item Filter paper strips $\approx 2\textrm{cm}\times10\textrm{cm}$
	\item Digital Multimeter
	\item Alligator clips
	\item 150ml Plastic bottle - x16
	\item Tweezers 
	\item 1L Distilled water

\end{itemize}
\newpage
\textbf{Procedure}
\small
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Pour varying amounts of $CUSO_4$ into 150ml plastic bottles and dilute with distilled water to form solutions with concentrations $1.00\textrm{M}, 0.85\textrm{M}, 0.70\textrm{M}, 0.55\textrm{M}, 0.40\textrm{M}, 0.30\textrm{M}, 0.20\textrm{M and } 0.10\textrm{M}$.
	
	\item Fill 8 of the 150ml plastic bottles with 30ml of 1M $ZnSO_4$ and set aside with copper solutions. 
	
	\item Polish electrodes with emery paper until they their entire surface is free of visible oxidation then connect to alligator clips.
	
	\item Connect alligator clips to multimeter and set to DC voltage mode.
	
	\item Transfer the contents of a $CUSO_4$, and $ZnSO_4$ container into separate beakers.
	
	\item Wet salt bridge with $KNO_3$ and rest over the lip of both beakers, so that it is partially submerged in both. 
	
	\item Add the electrodes to the solution and record result as soon as value settles.
	
	\item Remove electrodes immediately and wash with distilled water. Stir electrolyte solutions with a glass stir rod. Remove salt bridge and dispose of.
	
	\item Reconstruct cell with a new salt bridge, add electrodes back, and repeat measurementation so that there are three trials in total for any given concentration.
	
	\item Safely dispose of electrolyte solutions, wash equipment, and repeat for next $CUSO_4$ concentration.

\subsection{Analysis of Evidence}
The scatter plot produced using experimental data suggests a linear relationship. Using desmos, a linear regression can be utilised to find the line of best fit. 





Theory would suggest it should be logarithmic 

if we substitute the parameters of the nirnst equation (this part needs more working)

consider half equation $Cu^{2+}+Zn \rightarrow Zn^{2+} + Cu$ \textbf{(possibly show how half equation is derived)}

finding Q: Since Cu2+ and Zn2+ are the only aqueous parts of each side of the half equation, they're the only ones counted
there's a linear relationship

\begin{align*}
	(0.3419+0.7618)-&\frac{8.31446261815324\cdot298}{2\cdot96485}\cdot\ln\frac{[Zn^{2+}]}{[Cu^{2+}]}\\
	=(0.3419+0.7618)-&\frac{8.31446261815324\cdot298}{2\cdot96485}\cdot\ln\frac{1}{1}
	&=0.907960129242\textrm{V}
\end{align*}
