### Bio-fuel
Bio-gasoline
### Existing Fuel Source
Petroleum
## Background
Explore the chemical synthesis of a biofuel produced from agae and its comparison with existing fuel sources and which of the two fuel sources has a lower cost per unit of energy. 

### What are algal fuels?

#### Why are algal fuels being investigated?

Algal fuels are considered 'Third Generation' biofuels, developed to improve the viability of biomass derived fuels at large scale. Third generation fuels are derived from aquatic biomass, and therefore do not compete with traditional land based agriculture. Another advantage is reduced waste products due to lack of cellulose and fibrous materials. These fuels require more water than their predecessors, but can grow in high salinity environments, like the ocean.

#### What fuels are created by algae
While third generation fuel sources can processed into ethanol, similarly to maize or sugar cane, their high oil and lipid content allows them to be refined into previously impractical fuel options. 
Biogasoline is one of these, and is touted as a 'drop in replacement' for unleaded gasoline. 
##### Well what is biogasoline?

### Research question
How do does the collection and cracking processes differ between synthesis of gasoline and biogasoline, and how do the final products  
## Categories of comparison
### Aquisition and refinery of crude oil

Our current crude oil reserves are the result of organic matter pyrolysing underground over "millions of years". 
https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Oil_formation
Pyrolysis the process of breaking down longer "heavy" hydrocarbon chains, into smaller, "lighter" products in the absence of free oxygen molecules. In this case, the long molecules that make up the organic matter are broken down into more simple chains. Molecules not present in the shorter chains, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen, form by products such as $H_2O$ (water), $NH_3$ (ammonia), $CO$ (carbon monoxide) and $CO_2$ (carbon dioxide).

Oil is pumped from "wells", stored in, and sold by the barrel. 
https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Oil_formation
While the product collected is heterogeneous, and contains a huge variety of unusable hydrocarbons, further pyrolysis under controlled conditions and in the presence of a catalyst permits controlled reformation of the crude product, into useful and refined fuels. These products can
then be separated through fractional distillation.

### Production of Bio Oil
#### How is algae produced
While natural cultivation was used initially due to its low capital cost, artificial cultivation is more viable for fuel production on industrial scale. Environmental conditions are controlled using closed loop systems and key consumables, notably $CO_2$, water, and nutrients, are dispersed throughout the system as as required. The system itself can take the form of either 'raceways' or tubes, however both fundamentally do the same thing; circulate algae from storage into a light rich environment so that photosynthesis occurs, then back into storage. Photosynthesis allows the algae to 'capture' the carbon from the $CO_2$ bubbled into the system, or from the open air, while simultaneously releasing the oxygen attached to the carbon.

As the algae grows and reproduces, carbon will accumulate in the system in the form of glucose, and within the oils that algae produce to store energy long term. The oils produced by certain species of algae contain high content of lipid's; a portion of which are fatty acids. Fatty acids are long hydrocarbon chains with a carboxyl group at one end.
Harvested biomass is processed, and oils are extracted. The dried biomass then undergoes pyrolysis, which converts any remaining compounds into bio-oil, and similar by-products to crude oil.

###### Processing/Synthesis of fuel
Processing of algal/bio-oils is less efficient than crude oils. Since the main source of hydrocarbon chains is fatty acids, the carboxyl group adds a significant amount of oxygen to the reaction mixture. While pyrolysis of crude oil is often aided by a catalyst, effective pyrolysis of bio oils requires one. 

*Biogasoline production by co‐cracking of model compound mixture of bio‐oil and ethanol over HSZM‐5* by Wang et al demonstrated the poor cracking performance, and investigated the effect of temperature, pressure, additives, and presence of a catalyst on the yield of high grade hydrocarbon fuels. It was found that the addition of ethanol to the cracking mixture improved yields significantly. Ethanol improves the $H/C_\textrm{eff}$ (Hydrogen to carbon effective ratio) of reactants, which was previously found to improve cracking performance. Furthermore, the oxygen present in the hydroxyl group ($OH$) is likely to join with excess carbon to form $CO_x$ compounds and $H_2O$, as opposed to forming $CH_3COOH$ (acetic acid) or other by-products/coking agents.

Ethanol


At $400\degree C, 2MPa$, $99\%$ and $91.5\%$ of the product was hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons by weight respectively. While coking did occur, use of the catalyst HSZM-5 improved yields, and was stable enough for coke removal to be achieved through combustion, allowing for reuse of catalyst. The high hydrocarbon content of the final product is commendable, this does not equate to a high yield. The overall selectivity, or ratio of oil weight to final usable product weight, was $31.5\%$, which is lower than crude oil's $43.3\%$ when it is cracked to form components of similar high quality fuel at lab scale.

[[Crude oil cracking.pdf]]

Overall, while bio-oil derived from algal sources has a lower energy content, due to high oxygen presence in fatty acids, cracking performance is shown to be excellent at lab scale, and strongly resembles current crude oil cracking operations at large scale. While yield by weight is lower, it is still competitive considering the technology discussed is still in its infancy, and has potential for development and industrialisation.

**Pyrolysis Oil**

- Produced through pyrolysis, a thermochemical process that heats organic materials to 400–800°C in the absence of oxygen.
- The process breaks down complex molecules into smaller ones, resulting in a liquid known as pyrolysis oil or bio-oil.
- Contains a high proportion of oxygenated compounds such as acids, aldehydes, and phenols.
- Chemically unstable due to its composition.
- Has a lower energy density compared to crude oil because of its high oxygen content.

**Crude Oil**

- Formed naturally over geological time from the decomposition of organic matter under high pressure and temperature.
- Extracted from underground reservoirs through drilling.
- Composed primarily of hydrocarbons.
- More chemically stable than pyrolysis oil.
- Has a higher energy density due to its lower oxygen content.

#### Carbon "neutral"
CO2 absorbed is actually just re-emitted when it is burnt, however this is still better than just releasing carbon with fossil fuels. 






### Energy content/Chemical Make up (and vehicle compatibility)

![[Pasted image 20250708151954.png]]
##### [[indianpaper.pdf]]
This paper does not even distinguish between regular gasoline and biogasoline. It seems their makeup is similar enough that the deviation in combustion characteristics is smaller than that of different regular gasoline blends.


### Cost
[[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biteb.2021.100901]]
For biogasoline, this paper claims that in the best case, it costs about 6 USD/GGE (Gallon gasoline equivalent)
So for the same amount of energy in one gallon of gasoline, it costs 6 USD rather than 3.167 USD (20/7/2025)
https://gasprices.aaa.com/

This is currently roughly double the average cost of fuel in the US, and this is just production cost
