## Defining how strength is measured
### Define "Strong" and "Weak"
Stronger $\implies$ Can dissociate or break down into its cation in water more easily. i.e. easier to ionise or dissociate

### Strength of acids

### Strength of bases

### Examples

#### Slides
1. HCL is strong acid because it dissociates completely in water:
$${\ce{}HCL_{(g)} + H_2 O _{(I)} \rightarrow Cl^-_{(aq)} + H_3O^-_{(aq)}}$$

2. NaOH is a strong base because it dissociates completely in water
$$HCl_{(g)} + H_2O_{(l)} \rightarrow Cl^{-}_{(aq)} + H_3O^{-}_{(aq)}
$$
3. Ethanoic acid  ($CH_3COOH$) , or 'the acid in vinegar', is a weak acid. It only partially dissociates and actually sits in equilibrium 
$$CH_3COOH_{(aq)} + H_2O_{(l)} \rightleftharpoons CH_3COO^{-}_{(aq)} + H_3O^{+}_{(aq)}
$$

#### Worked example 4.1
##### Write the equilibrium constants for the following reactions
###### $CH_3COOH+H_2O \rightleftharpoons H_3O^+ + CH_3COO^-$
Clearly $K_a=\frac{[H_3O^+][CH_3COO^-]}{[CH_3COOH]}$

###### $NH_3 + H_2O \rightleftharpoons NH_3^+  OH_-$
Clearly $K_b=\frac{[NH_4^+][OH^-]}{[NH_3]}$


### The relationship between $K_a$ and $K_b$
$K_a \cdot K_b = K_w$
and 
$K_w = 1.0\times 10^-14$ at $25\degree C$ 
Where 
- $K_w$ is the the water dissociation constant
