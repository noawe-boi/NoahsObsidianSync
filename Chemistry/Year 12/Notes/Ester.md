### What are esters
"What happens if we join the first part from [[Alcohol]], and the second part from acid."
The ester functional group contains a [[Carbonyl]] group attached to an oxygen that is linked to another carbon

Can form from [[Primary alcohol]], [[Secondary Alcohols]], but not [[Tertiary Alcohols]] as it is too hard to 'get to' the functional group of it
### Naming esters
1. Assign the carbon in the functional group as "carbon 1"
2. Count the number of carbons in the chain attached to the [[Carbonyl]] group, name the chain add add the suffix 'oate'
3. count the number of carbons attached to the oxygen.
4. Name the main chain.
5. Add the suffix 'yl'

### Example
#### Methyl-ethan-oate
```smiles
CC(=O)OC
```
- Two carbons in the first carbon chain. We are gonna consider this its own little thing.
	- Consider the alkane name - ethane. This is an ester, therefore we add 'oate' to the end.
-  Consider the $CH_3$ group, this is methyl
- Therefore this is methyl ethanoate
