#### Hydration
The addition of water across a double bond.
	Produced alcohol
	Requires high temperatures ($>100\degree$), high pressure, and catalyst
		The catalyst in this case is a strong acid (dilute $H_2SO_4$), it helps break the water down so that the ethane can pick up individual pieces of the water. 
#### Formula
$$\textrm{Alkene} + H_2O \rightarrow \textrm{ High temp, high pressure, strong acid}\rightarrow Alcohol$$

###### Hydration of ethene
Consider ethene
$H_2C=CH_2$ 
```smiles
C=C
```
Now consider water
$H_2O$ 
```smiles
O
```

When we combine water (as steam) and ethene, the double bond breaks up into 2 free single bonds. We have an $OH$ group attach to one, and a $H$ attach to another
```smiles
OC-C
```
This forms ethanol
