#### Hydration
The addition of water across a double bond.
	Produced alcohol
	Requires high temperatures ($>100\degree$), high pressure, and catalyst
		The catalyst in this case is a strong acid, it helps break the water down so that the ethane can pick up individual pieces of the water. 
#### Formula
$$\textrm{Alkene} + H_2O \rightarrow \textrm{ High temp, high pressure, strong acid}\rightarrow Alcohol$$
