### What is a homologous series
- A group of compounds that share a formula and functional group. 
- They generally have similar properties.
### Examples 
#### [[Alkane]]s
The formula for Alkanes is:
![[Alkane#Formula]]

Alkanes lack a functional group - so technically they all have the same lack of functional group.

##### Ethane
Ethane has 2 carbons
Clearly $n=2$
Therefore there will be $2\cdot 2 + 2= 6$ hydrogen

#### Alcohols
