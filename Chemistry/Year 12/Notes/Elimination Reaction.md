### Elimination reactions
The removal or substituents from two adjacent carbon atoms in a haloalkane ([[Organic Compounds and Halogens (Haloalkanes)]])

**The opposite of an addition reaction**
	Splits up a 

#### Formula
$$\textrm{Haloaknane + }NaOH\rightarrow \textrm{High Temperature} \rightarrow \textrm{Alkene + Salt + Water} $$
i.e. $\textrm{Haloalkane} \rightarrow \textrm{Alkene}$
#### How haloalkane type affects reaction. 

##### Teritary 
- Undergoes elimination reaction
##### Secondary 
Undergoes a mixture of elimination and substation 


When using ethanol as a solvent, higher temperatures and higher concentrations of sodium hydroxide lal favor the haloalkane undergoing an elimination reaction
