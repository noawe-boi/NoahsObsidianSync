### What are Alcohols?
Alcohols are a class of organic compounds that contains the [[Hydroxyl]] functional group. 
#### Naming alcohols
Find the main chain and ad '**ol**' as suffix that is immediately preceded by the locant.
#### Properties 
##### Polar molecule
Since the $C-O$ bond is polar, the carbon becomes susceptible to attack by electromotive molecules seeking charge
##### Boiling point
- Much higher than corresponding alkaline due to $OH$ bond introducing [[Dipole Dipole Forces]] and [[Hydrogen Bond]]s. 
- Increases with number of carbons due to increased [[Dispersion Force]]s. 
- Becomes more similar to corresponding [[Alkane]]s with increased carbons
- Affected by [[Types of alcohols]]. Decreases from primary to tertiary due to hydrogen bonding being less effective when alcohol group is crowded (in the case of [[Tertiary Alcohols]])

##### Solubility in water
###### Small Alcohols
- Dissolve easily in water due to new hydrogen bonds formed with water having similar strength to the pre-existing hydrogen bonds between alcohol molecules. 
###### Larger alcohols
- As length increases, solubility decreases. This is because most of the water can only form [[Dispersion Force]]s with the alcohol. A larger ratio of the chain is just dispersion forces, and not hydrogen bonds. 
##### Solubility in organic solvents. 
##### Small alcohols
Organic molecules can only form dispersion forces with the non polar part of the chain
###### Larger alcohols
Larger alcohols have larger non polar sections of the hydrocarbon chain. Therefore there are stronger dispersion forces. 
#### Formula
$C_nH_{2n+1}+OH$
