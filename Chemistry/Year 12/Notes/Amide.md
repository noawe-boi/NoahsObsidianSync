### What are amides?
A class of organic compound derived from carboxylic acid. 
Functional group contains a carbonyl group attached to an amine group.

#### Primary, secondary, teritary
Determined b the number of [[Alkyl]] groups bonded to the carboxyl and amine of amide group

### Naming Amides
1. identify the main chain 
```smiles 	
CC(=O)N
```
The main chain is attached to the $R$ group ($CH_3$ in this case) 

2. number the carbonyl carbon as "carbon 1"
3. add the suffix amide
4. use $N$ to represent bonds to the nitrogen atom in complex amide molecules
