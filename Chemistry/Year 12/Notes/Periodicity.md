## Definition
The trends we see across the periodic table

## What can be found using periodicity?

### State of matter at room temperature
#### Trend
- Across a period, to the right, elements generally more from a solid to a gaseous state
#### Why?
Â - Due to types of bonds and structures formed by elements (strong, (solid) lattice structures or weak structres that are easily broken and cause a state change to either a liquid or a gas)

### [[Chemistry/Year 12/Notes/Core charge]]
#### Trend
![[Chemistry/Year 12/Notes/Core charge]]



### Atomic radii
#### Trend
- **right across period $\rightarrow$ smaller atomic radii**
- *down group $\rightarrow$ bigger atomic radii*
#### Why?
- **Core charge increases, electron shells the same**
	- **Valence electrons more attracted to nucleus**

- *Core charge constant, number of electrons shells increasing
	- *Valence electrons less attracted to nucleus*


### Electronic configuration
#### Trend
Electronic Configurations are similar.
#### Why?
e.g. Group 1 elements all hvae one electron in an S subshell, which explains t their softness,. and high reactivity.

### First [[Ionisation Energy]] and [[Chemistry/Year 12/Notes/Electronegativity]]
#### Trend
Decrease as you go down the group
Increases across a period

- Higher atomic number $\rightarrow$ higher ionisation energy $\because$ more protons
-  Smaller atomic radius $\rightarrow$ Lower ionisation energy $\because$ Futher apart $\implies$ less force
- Within the same shell $\rightarrow$ increases ionisation energy $\because$ atom becomes more positively charged
- Electron shielding $\rightarrow$ lower ionisation energy $\because$ repulsion between electrons


### Reactivity with water
#### Trend
##### Reactivity of metals
- **Down the group $\rightarrow$ More reactive**
- *Group 1 metals reactivity > group 2 metals reactivity*

#### Why?

##### Reactivity of metals
- **Number of electron shells increases down a group $\because$ (see electron configuration section)** 
	**![[Pasted image 20241013125303.png | 350]]**

**$\therefore$ electrons are 'less tightly held'**

- *Core charge increases across a period (as you go from left to right). Clearly group 2 has more core charge and therefore electrons are helf more tightly*
