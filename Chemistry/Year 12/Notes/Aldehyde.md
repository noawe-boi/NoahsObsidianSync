### What are aldehydes
#### Formula
$RCHO$
#### Functional Groups
aldehydes have a [[Carbonyl]] group on the end of the main chain (carbon number 1)
	This is a double bond oxygen on the end of the chain
#### Condensed formula
When writing carbonyl groups in the condensed formula, consider making the $C=O$ and $C-H$ bonds apparent. 
We write this as $CHO$ on the end of the main chain 
#### Naming aldehydes
1. Identify the main chain
2. omit the final letter 'e'
3. add 'al' to suffix
You do not need to indicate the position of the [[Carbonyl]] because it is always on the end of the main chain in the case of an aldehyde. This is indicated by the naming
