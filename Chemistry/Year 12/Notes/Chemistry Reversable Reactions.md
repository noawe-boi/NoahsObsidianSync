## What are reversable reactions?
- Reactions that can be made to proceed in either direction
- Either
	Forward
	- Left to right
or
	 Backwards
	 - Right to left

Reversable Reactions are referred to as Equilibrium reactions, and proceed until the concentration of products and reactants becomes uniform. However it does not have to be equal.
### Examples
Heating solid calcium hydroxide in a closed container results in it decomposing into calcium oxide and water

$$Ca(OH)_2 \space _{(s)} \rightarrow Ca) \space _{(s)} + H_2O \space _{(g)}$$

However is solid calcium oxide is mixed with water, some of it will turn back into calcium hydroxide

$$Ca) \space _{(s)} + H_2O \space _{(g)}  \rightarrow  Ca(OH)_2 \space _{(s)}$$

Neither of these reactions proceeds to completion, instead the reactants and product concentrations become steady.

The equation for this reversable reaction is 
$$Ca) \space _{(s)} + H_2O \space _{(g)}  \rightleftharpoons  Ca(OH)_2 \space _{(s)}$$
