## What are reversable reactions?
- Reactions that can be made to proceed in either direction
- Either
	Forward
	- Left to right
or
	 Backwards
	 - Right to left

Reversable Reactions are referred to as Equilibrium reactions, and proceed until the concentration of products and reactants becomes uniform. However it does not have to be equal.
### Examples
Heating solid calcium hydroxide in a closed container results in it decomposing into calcium oxide and water

$$Ca(OH)_2 \space _{(s)} \rightarrow Ca) \space _{(s)} + H_2O \space _{(g)}$$

However is solid calcium oxide is mixed with water, some of it will turn back into calcium hydroxide

$$Ca) \space _{(s)} + H_2O \space _{(g)}  \rightarrow  Ca(OH)_2 \space _{(s)}$$

Neither of these reactions proceeds to completion, instead the reactants and product concentrations become steady.

The equation for this reversable reaction is 
$$Ca) \space _{(s)} + H_2O \space _{(g)}  \rightleftharpoons  Ca(OH)_2 \space _{(s)}$$

## Energy profile diagrams
- The energy profile diagram is flipped when the reaction goes the opposite direction

## Types of systems
### Open Systems/Steady State system
- Both matter and energy is exchanged

- Adding new material as the products are removed 
### Closed Systems
- Only energy is exchanged
- [[Dynamic Equilibrium]] only occurs in this system: i.e.
	- Reversable reactions must be carried out in closed systems in order to reach equilibrium. 

### Isolated systems
- No matter or energy is exchanged
- Irrelevant
