## Definition
An unstable arrengeements of atoms that forms momentarily at the peak of the activation energy barrier
*This is the transition state between the product and reactant*

This will result in either 
- Formation of product
or
- Reformation of reactants

*Both outcomes are equally likely*
### Examples
- Carbon and oxygen react when charcoal burns. This does require a very high activation energy.
- Lowkey like a roller coaster
