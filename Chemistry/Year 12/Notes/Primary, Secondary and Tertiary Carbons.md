#### Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Carbons

##### Primary
The first carbon is connected to one other carbon
- Most reactive as functional group is out in the open and weakly bonded
##### Secondary
The first carbon is connected to two other carbons
- Less reactive than primary, but still shows some properties of functional group
##### Tertiary
The first carbon is connected to three other carbons (in the middle of the branch)
- Least reactive
