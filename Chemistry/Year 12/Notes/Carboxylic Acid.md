### What is [[Carboxylic Acid]]
Organic compound that have a carboxyl functional group.
===It should be emphasised that this is an ACID!===
#### The main chain
The chain containing the $COOH$ group becomes the main chain the the [[Carboxyl]] carbon is carbon 1.
#### Formula
$RCOOH$
### Naming carboxylic acids

1. Count the carbons. 
2. omit the final 'e'
3. add 'oic acid'
The [[Carboxyl]] carbon is numbered 1 but **do not include the locant for the $COOH$ group in the name**
(it could not be an acid if it was not in that location. Never put a number in the name. If there is anything else then it will be in front of the main chain name)
