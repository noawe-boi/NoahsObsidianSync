### The Haber Process
The haber process reacts hdyrogen and nitrogen to produce ammonia
#### Temperature
The temperature is kept low to shift equilibrium to the right, which produces higher ammonia concentration.

However, lower temperature also leads to lower rate of reaction. 

**In industry, a compromise between high concentration, and high rate of reaction is used**

#### Pressure
Considering the equilibrium reaction, higher pressure will lead to equilibrium shifting right, therefore causing higher ammonia concentration. Higher pressure also causes higher rate of reaction. 
**therefore the pressure should be a high as financially possible**
*Remember that higher pressure also requires more energy to reach that pressure, and also requires reinforced equipment.*

#### Catalyst 
Increases ROR. Doesnt get used up so 
**Catalyst is used**


#### Other considerations
- Reactants must be replaced
- Atmospheric gasses like $CO_2$ and $S$ must be kept out, as they cause contamination of the catalyst. 
- No oxygen can be present due to the risk of combustion or alternative reactions. 

### The contact process
Used to produce sulphuric acid through a series of steps
$S+O_2 \rightarrow SO_2$ 
Sulphur is combusted in a furnace or through other means 

$SO_2 + O_2 \rightleftharpoons 2SO_3$ 
Sulphur dioxide reacts with oxygen to form sulphur trioxide (reversible)

$SO_3 + H_2 SO_4 \rightarrow H_2S_2O_7$ 
Sulphuric acid reacts with sulphur trioxide to form oleum

$H_2S_2O_7 + H_2O \rightarrow 2H_2SO_4$
Water reacts with oleum to form 2 moles of sulphuric acid

#### Why oleum?
Oleum is safer to transport than other reactants. Reacting sulphur trioxide with water is extremely exothermic and creates a corrosive mist of sulphuric acid.

#### managing reaction conditions (in step 2)
##### Temperautre

Since reaction is exothermic, therefore lower temp will shift equilibrium to the right, resulting in higher yield of $SO_3$. 
However lower temp $\implies$ lower ROR
**Therefore we compromise**

##### Pressure 
Higher pressures increase yield due to less moles on product side
Higher pressure would also result in higher ROR 
**However in industry only 1-2 atm are used because its expensive to reach higher pressures, and yields of like 99.5% are produced at low pressure in this reaction so its not really neccecary**

##### Catalyst 
**Catalyst is used in "absorption tower", which is similar to catalytic cracking**
