### What is it?
If you heat a haloalkane with a solution of sodium or potassium hydroxide in 50:50 ethanol and water under reflux, the halogen substituent is replaced by a hydroxyl functional group (to product an alcohol).
The nature of this substitution means that a primary haloalkane will produce a primary alcohol, a secondary haloalkane would produce a secondary alcohol, and a tertiary haloalkane would produce a tertiary alcohol.



### Requirements
$$\textrm{Haloalkane + Sodium / Potassium Hydroxide} \rightarrow \textrm{Alcohol + Metal Halide (salt)}$$
