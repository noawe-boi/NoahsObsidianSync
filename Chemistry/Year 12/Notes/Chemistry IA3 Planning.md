### Existing Fuel Source
Petroleum
## Background
Explore the chemical synthesis of a biofuel produced from agae and its comparison with existing fuel sources

### What are algal fuels?

#### Why are algal fuels being investigated?

Third Generation 
		- Derived from aquatic biomass - rather than food or inedible agriculture
		- Do not compete with land based agriculture
		- Produce less waste products than their predecessors 
		- Requires significant water

#### What fuels are created by algae
- Biogasoline
	- Touted as a 'drop in replacement' for gasoline. 
##### Well what is biogasoline?
Very low production at the moment, may not be cost effective without advancements in the industry.
### Research question
How do does the collection and cracking processes differ between synthesis of gasoline and biogasoline, and how do the final products differ.  

## Categories of comparison
### Synthesis process and emissions during it

biofuel:
algae -> pyrolysis/cracking (Converts it into hydrocarbons) -> Biogasoline 

#### Starting products (Chemical make up)
Bio oil is extracted from algal biomass using pyrolyis 
Pyrolysis is decomposing a material by heating it in an inert enviroment, where combustion cannot occur. (https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/wyndmoor-pa/eastern-regional-research-center/docs/biomass-pyrolysis-research-1/what-is-pyrolysis/)

#### Cracking (Transformation)

***pyrolysis of alkanes is also named as cracking**.*

Talk about catalytic cracking (distillation) https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/oil-and-petroleum-products/refining-crude-oil-the-refining-process.php

Both conventional and 'bio' gasoline are produced via distillation of oils.

#### Upgrading hydrocarbons


##### [[indianpaper.pdf]]
Page "26": Makes good points about how algae does not compete with traditional agriculture.

#### Carbon "neutral"
CO2 absorbed is actually just re-emitted when it is burnt, however this is still better than just releasing carbon with fossil fuels. 






### Energy content/Chemical Make up (and vehicle compatibility)

##### [[indianpaper.pdf]]
This paper does not even distinguish between regular gasoline and biogasoline. It seems their makeup is similar enough that the deviation in combustion characteristics is smaller than that of different regular gasoline blends.


### Cost
[[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biteb.2021.100901]]
For biogasoline, this paper claims that in the best case, it costs about 6 USD/GGE (Gallon gasoline equivalent)
So for the same amount of energy in one gallon of gasoline, it costs 6 USD rather than 3.167 USD (20/7/2025)

This is currently roughly double the average cost of fuel in the US, and this is just production cost
