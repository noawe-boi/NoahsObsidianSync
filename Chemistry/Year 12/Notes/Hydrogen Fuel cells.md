### Under acidic conditions
Phosphoric acid is used as an **electrolyte**. Operates at 150-200C  
  
The electrolyte is crucial as it only allows appropriate ions to flow (such as hydrogen ions in this case)  
  
Hydrogen enters at the **Anode** and loses its electrons.   
Electrons flow the **Anode**, through the load, and to the **Cathode**   
Oxygen enters the fuel cell at the **Cathode** and combine with the Hydrogen Ions that have travelled through the electrolyte.

Hydrogen molecules are oxidised at the anode  
$2H_2 \rightarrow 4H^+ + 4e^-$  
Hydrogen ions (positively charged, no electrons) flow the electrolyte. Electrons travel through the load. They both meet with oxygen at he cathode   
$O_2 + 4H^+ + 4e^- \rightarrow 2H_2O$  
Overall reaction  
$2H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O$
### Under alkaline conditions
#### How does it work?
An alkaline solution such as NaOH or KOH is in the centre and acts as an **Electrolyte**   

The electrolyte is crucial as it only allows appropriate ions to flow (such as hydroxide ions in this case) 
  
At the **Anode,** Hydroxide  ions are reduced by hydrogen, which releases electrons and produces water.   
At the **Cathode**, Oxygen is fed in, and is reduced by the incoming electrons and water present.   
This forms Hydroxide ions, which flow through the electrolyte to the **Anode** to repeat the cycle.

#### Half equations
Hydrogen is oxidised, producing water and releasing electrons  
$H_2 + 2OH^- \rightarrow 2H_2O + 2e^-$
  
Oxygen is reduced by electrons, and forms hydroxide ions with water in electrolyte solution.   
$O_2 + 2H_2O +4e^- \rightarrow 4OH^-$  
  
Overall equation  
$2H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O + \textrm{Heat Energy}$
