## Definitions
- **Literally the same thing as equilibrium**
- Dynamic equilibrium is the state at which the rate of forward reaction is equal to the rate of the reverse reaction
	- i.e. product is being formed at the same rate that is transformed back into the reactants

- This result in a macroscopic null change in concentration, however on a microscopic level the concentration is constantly interchanging between products and reactants



## Conditions for dynamic equilibrium
- Reaction is incomplete (does not consist of only products)
- Bonds are being broken and formed constantly
- Rates of the forward and reverse reaction are equal
	- *This does NOT mean that the concentration of products and reactants have to be equal*
