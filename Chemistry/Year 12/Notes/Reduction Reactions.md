### What are they 
- Gain of hydrogen atoms, 
or
- The loss of oxygen atoms. 
 [[Chemistry Redox Reactions]]
### Reduction of [[Alkene]]s and [[Alkyne]]s
Hydrogen is added across a double or triple bond, increasing level of saturation ([[Saturated compound]])
(Also known as catalytic [[Hydrogenation]])
### Requirements
- high temperature $(300C\degree)$
- hydrogen gas
- metal catalyst ($Pt, Pd, Ni$)

#### Reduction of nitriles
Nitriles can be reduced to primary amines with lithium aluminium hydride ($LiAlH_4$) in the presence of water. You can also use hydrogen gas and a metal catalyst such as palladium, platinum or nickel to reduce nitriles â€“ the same reagents used to reduce alkenes. This reaction also requires a high temperature and pressure.
