### What is mass spectrometry?
A molecule is vaporised and ionised using an electron beam. When it ionises it can fragment into radicals and cations. Only the cations will reach the detector. 

The graph given to us is the relative abundance of the cations ($y$-axis), and the mass over the charge $\left(\frac{m}{z}\right)$ of the cation ($x$-axis). 

### The 13 rule
The weight of a $CH$ group is 13 $AMU$. By dividing the weight of the molecule by 13, we find the maximum number of carbons
$$\lfloor{\frac{m}{13}}\rfloor=\textrm{Maximum n.o carbon atoms}$$
Where:
- $m$ is the mass of hte molecular ion. 

By adding the remainder of this operation to the number of carbon atoms, we find the maximum number of hydrogen atoms. 

$$\frac{m}{13}-\lfloor\frac{m}{13}\rfloor=\textrm{remainder}=r$$
$$\lfloor\frac{m}{13}\rfloor+r=\textrm{Number of hydrogens}$$

### Nitrogen is odd
If a molecule has an odd number of nitrogen's, it will have a molecular ion with an odd $m/z$ value. 
- If the $m/z$ value is odd then you can assume the molecule has **one** nitrogen. 

### Remember:
#### Mass of methyl groups, etc
- $mm(CH)=13AMU$
- $mm(CH_2) = 14AMU$
- $mm(CH_3)=15AMU$

#### The method
Consider the masses you know:
If it is a keytone or aldehyde, then it contains one oxygen and one of the carbons will only be bonded to an oxygen
