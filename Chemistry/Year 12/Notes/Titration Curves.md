### What are titration curves?
Titration curves show the $pH$ of a solution as a volume of solution is added to another. 
#### Interpreting titration curves. 
##### The equivalence point. 
When the moles of titrant added becomes equal to the moles of the analyte solution, the $pH$ becomes neutral. However, the point that this occurs can be a very small window, and will usually have a very steep gradient. It may seem instantaneous in the case of a strong acid and strong base combination. 
##### Strong Acid + Strong base
The graph below is an example of a strong acid, reacting with a strong base. 
- The curve starts off low, this indicates that we start with an acid. 
- The titration curve is trending upwards. It begins at 1, and ends at 12. Clearly a base is being added to raise the $pH$. 
- As the volume of titrant added approaches $50.0mL$, the equivalence point is reached 
- As we push past the equivalence point, the solution reaches $pH$ of titrant

##### Weak acid + strong base/strong acid + weak base
Pretty much the same as strong acid/strong base but with a less sudden/steep equivalence point.


##### Weak acid + weak base
The curve is gonna be all kinds of messed up. The equivalence point must be found using maths instead of visually. 

$pK_a = -\log K_a$
$K_a = 10^{-pK_a}$
$K_{a\textrm{ monoprotic acid}} = \frac{[H_3O^+][A^-]}{[HA]}=\frac{[H^+]}{[HA]}$

### Questions involving titration curves

We know that when the volume of $HCL$ is 0, $pH$=10.5. 
Considering $pH=14-pOH$, clearly $pOH=3.5$
$pOH=-\log_{10}(OH^-)$
$\therefore OH^-=10^{-pOH}=10^{-3.5}$
$\therefore$ answer is C
