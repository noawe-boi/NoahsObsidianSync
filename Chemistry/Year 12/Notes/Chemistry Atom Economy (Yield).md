### What is it?
The yield or economic viability of a reaction. 

A measure of how many of the starting reactant materials that actually become part of the desired products. Also means how much of the final product is the desired product. 

e.g. 10% atom economy means that only 10% of starting atoms end up in final product. 
	Also means 10% of the final product weight is the desired product. 

### Formula for atom economy
$$\textrm{\% atom economy} = \frac{\textrm{molar mass of desired prodcts}}{\textrm{sum of all molar masses of all REACTANTS}} \cdot 100$$
The total molar mass of all reactants is equal to the molar mass of all products. So as long as your desired product is correct, you can use the weight of all products OR all reactants. 
### Examples
1. Consider $CaCN_2 + 3H_2O \rightarrow CaCO_3 + 2NH_3$ 
$MM(CaCO_3) = 100.087g$ - desired product


$MM(CaCN_2)= 18.014$ - reactant 1
$MM(H_2O)=18.014$ - reactant 2

Solving for H_2O$ 
$MM(CaCN_2) + 3\cdot MM(H_2O) = 134.144g$ is the weight of all products. 
$\therefore \textrm{Atom economy}= \frac{100.087}{134.144}\cdot 100\approx 74.6116114026\%$
Therefore only $\approx$ 74.61% of the atoms in the product are the desired product.
