## What are outer molecular forces?
Forces that occur between complete molecules, like between water molecules in a cup of water

## What do these forces effect?
### Melting/Boiling points
- Stronger inter molecular forces $\implies$ Higher melting/boiling points
### Vapour Pressure
- Stronger inter molecular forces $\implies$ lower vapour pressure. i.e. lower pressure required to cause liquid to vaporise
### Solubility
#### Why does "like dissolve like"
Polar molecules are attracted to the charged regions of other polar molecules, causing them to interact and form a solution. 

When a polar and non polar molecule are mixed together, there are no charged regions in the non polar molecules, therefore the polar molecules will not be attracted to them. This lack of attraction causes them to not mix well

When non polar molecules are mixed, they do not require a charged region for attraction, and they are able to mix freely to form a solution. 
#### Polar Molecules
Form stronger hydrogen, and dipole dipole bonds
Water soluble (because water is a polar molecule)
#### Non polar molecules
Form weak dispersion forces
Insoluble in polar solvents
soluble in polar solvents
