### Not rechargeable batteries/primary cells
- Galvanic cells are often called primary cells (noting that rechargeable batteries are called secondary cells)
- Alkaline batteries are an example of this (like AA or AAA)
	- These are also known as zinc-carbon galvanic cells
- A fuel cell is a galvanic cell that produces electricity using a constant supply of reactants and inert electrodes that do not break down.
