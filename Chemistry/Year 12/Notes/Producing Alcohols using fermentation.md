### What is fermentation
Fermentation is the chemical breakdown of a substance using a living microorganism such as yeast. 
### Fermentation of [[Glucose]]
$C_6H_{12} O_6 \rightarrow ^\textrm{yeast} 2C_2H_5OH_{aq} + 2CO_2$ 

#### Why yeast?
Yeast produced enzymes that catalyse the reaction of glucose into ethanol and $CO_2$ 

#### Considering environmental conditions
##### Temperature
Enzymes have an optimal temperature they operate at. 
- Temperature too high $\rightarrow$ enzymes will denature (lose their shape) and no longer be effective
- Temperature too low $\rightarrow$ enzymes work too slowly

**The optimal temperature for these enzymes is between $25-40^\circ C$**

##### Air
Fermentation must be conducted in an anerobic environment (no oxygen present) to prevent formation of by products 

##### Reactants
Must be aqueous so that yeast are killed off atÂ $\approx 15\%$ABV

##### Processing
Separated through fractional distillation.
