## What are acids and bases?
### Definitions
#### Acid
A substance which in solution produces hydrogen ($H^+$ or more strictly $H_3O^+$) ions, or hydronium ions. 
##### Strong Acid
Acid that readily or easily dissociates or dissolves into water
#### Base
A base is a substance that contains either the oxide ($O^{2+}$) or hydroxide ($OH^-$) ions, or produces them in solution.
##### Strong base
#### Alkali
A soluble base
#### Salt
An ionic compounded formed by neutralization reaction between acid and base 
## Common properties
### Acids
- Sour Taste
- Sting or burns skin
- Corrosive
- Conducts electricity in solution
- Acids turn blue litmus red (**B**lue in **A**cid goes **R**ed - **BAR**)
- Strong Acids have a pH of 0 - 2
- Weak Acids have a pH of 3 - 6
These are common because all acids produce hydrogen ions

### Bases
- Not many soluble bases
- Have a 'Soapy' feeling 
- Bitter taste
- Corrosive
- Conducts electricity in solution
- Turn red litmus blue
- Strong bases have a pH of 13 - 14 
- Weak bases have a pH of 8 - 12

## Acid Reactions
Acids and bases react in neutralization reactions to form salts
e.g. $HCl _{aq} + NaOH _{aq} \rightarrow NaCl _{aq} + H_2O _{I}$

### Common Reactions involving acids
- Metal + acid $\rightarrow$                                  salt + hydrogen gas
- Metal oxide + acid $\rightarrow$                         salt + water
- Metal carbonate + acid $\rightarrow$                  salt + water + $CO_2$ (limewater test)
- Metal hydrogen carbonate + acid $\rightarrow$  salt + water + $CO_2$ (extinguishing flame test)
- Metal sulphide + acid $\rightarrow$                     salt + hydrogen sulphide (run!)




## Strengths of Acids and Bases


![[Chemistry Strengths of Acids and Bases]]

## Strength vs Concentration 

$$\textrm{Strength} \neq \textrm{Concentration}$$
Remember that Strength is how easily an acid or base can dissociate, while concentration is how much of that acid there is present. A strong acid can be dilute, etc...

## Water as a weak electrolyte
Consider for water, $[H^+] = 1\times 10^{-14}M. 
Since $H^+$ is present but very weak, we can say that water is a weak electrolyte
