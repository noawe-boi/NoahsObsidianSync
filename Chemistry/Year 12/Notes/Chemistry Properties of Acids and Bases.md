## What are acids and bases?
### Definitions
#### Acid
A substance which in solution produces hydrogen ($H^+$ or more strictly $H_3O^+$) ions, or hydronium ions. 
#### Base
A base is a substance that contains either the oxide ($O^{2+}$) or hydroxide ($OH^-$) ions, or produces them in solution.
#### Alkali
A soluble base
#### Salt
An ionic compounded formed by neutralization reaction between acid and base 
## Common properties
### Acids
- Sour Taste
- Sting or burns skin
- Corrosive
- Conducts electricity in solution
- Acids turn blue litmus red (**B**lue in **A**cid goes **R**ed - **BAR**)
- Strong Acids have a pH of 0 - 2
- Weak Acids have a pH of 3 - 6
These are common because all acids produce hydrogen ions

### Bases
- Not many soluble bases
- Have a 'Soapy' feeling 
- Bitter taste
- Corrosive
- Conducts electricity in solution
- Turn red litmus blue
- Strong bases have a pH of 13 - 14 
- Weak bases have a pH of 8 - 12

## Acid Reactions
Acids and bases react in neutralization reactions to form salts
e.g. $HCl _{aq} + NaOH _{aq} \rightarrow NaCl _{aq} + H_2O _{I}$

### Common Reactions involving acids
- Metal + acid $\rightarrow$                                  salt + hydrogen gas
- Metal oxide + acid $\rightarrow$                         salt + water
- Metal carbonate + acid $\rightarrow$                  salt + water + $CO_2$ (limewater test)
- Metal hydrogen carbonate + acid $\rightarrow$  salt + water + $CO_2$ (extinguishing flame test)
- Metal sulphide + acid $\rightarrow$                     salt + hydrogen sulphide (run!)




## Strengths of Acids and Bases
### Define "Strong" and "Weak"
Stronger $\implies$ Can dissociate or break down into its cation in water more easily. i.e. easier to ionise or dissociate 

### Examples
1. HCL is strong acid because it dissociates completely in water:
$${\ce{}HCL_{(g)} + H_2 O _{(I)} \rightarrow Cl^-_{(aq)} + H_3O^-_{(aq)}}$$

2. NaOH is a strong base because it dissociates completely in water
$$HCl_{(g)} + H_2O_{(l)} \rightarrow Cl^{-}_{(aq)} + H_3O^{-}_{(aq)}
$$
3. Ethanoic acid  ($CH_3COOH$) , or 'the acid in vinegar', is a weak acid. It only partially dissociates and actually sits in equilibrium 
$$CH_3COOH_{(aq)} + H_2O_{(l)} \rightleftharpoons CH_3COO^{-}_{(aq)} + H_3O^{+}_{(aq)}
$$


## Strength vs Concentration 

$$\textrm{Strength} \neq \textrm{Concentration}$$
Remember that Strength is how easily an acid or base can dissociate, while concentration is how much of that acid there is present. A strong acid can be dilute, etc...
