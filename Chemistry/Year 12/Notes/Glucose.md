#### Formula
$C_6 H_12 O_6$

### Isomers of glucose
Glucose exists in two configurations, $\alpha$, and $\beta$. The only difference is the direction that the [[Hydroxyl]] group attached to the first carbon on the main chain goes. 
The $\alpha$ configuration has a downwards vertical bonds to the [[Hydroxyl]] group, while the $\beta$ configuration has an upwards diagonal bond.
