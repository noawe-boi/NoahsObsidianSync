### What are Alkenes 
Alkenes are [[Hydrocarbon]]s that contain a double bond between a pair of carbon atoms. This is why they are named differently. 

There are two less hydrogens than [[Alkane]]s because the carbons are bonded with each other. This is similar to the [[Isomers of Alkanes]], cyclohexane 
### Properties of Alkenes
#### Suffix
-ene

e.g. Ethene $C_2 H_4$ 
#### Rigidity
Due to the double bond there is increased rigidity 
#### General Formula
##### Homologous series
$C_nH_{2n}$
#### Functional group name
Carbon-Carbon double bond
### Considering the double bond location
Propene - $C_3H_6$
or
$CH_2CHCH_3$
Since one hydrogen in the middle is used up, and one on the left is used up, clearly the double bond is between the two $CH$ molecules with discrepancies. 
==Remember that carbon only has 4 bonding electrons==

Ethene - $C_2H_4$
Propene - $C_3H_6$
