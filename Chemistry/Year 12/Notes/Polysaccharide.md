### What are they
Polysaccharides are complex sugars made up of many monosaccharides (sometimes hundreds).
Long chains of smaller [[Carbohydrate]]s called [[Monosaccharide]]s
- Provide us with energy when they are oxidized.
- Held together by [[Glycosidic Linkage]]s. 
- Form when [[Monosaccharide]]s undergo [[Condensation Reactions]] (they are [[Condensation Polymer]]). 
### Types of [[Polysaccharide]]s
