### What is it?
[[Addition Polymer]] used in packaging. 
### Types of PE
**LDPE** (Low density), and **HDPE** (High density). 
*Higher density means less side chains, which allows the molecules to pack closer together.* 

#### LDPE
- [[Thermoplastic]]
- Has many branches
##### Production
Produced by passing ethene into a reactor with a small amount of oxygen and/or an organic peroxide at 1000-3000 atm, at temperatures of about $300\degree$

#### LDPE
- [[Thermoplastic]]
- Recyclable
- [[Crystalline]]
##### Production
Produced at low pressure and temperatures (single digit atm, about $60\degree$). 
Catalysts such as ziegler-natta and metallocene *OR* activated chromium/silica are used to allow formation of free radicals (uncharged molecules with an unpaired valence electron). There are no branches so the chains pack closely together.
