### Types of combustion

#### Complete combustion
When complete combustion occurs:
$$\textrm{Fuel + Oxygen} \rightarrow \textrm{Carbon Dioxide + Water + Heat + Light}$$

Realistically, we are not going to have enough oxygen molecules in the right place at the right time for complete combustion to occur. 
#### Incomplete combustion
$$\textrm{Fuel + Oxygen}\rightarrow \textrm{Carbon Soot + Carbon Monoxide + Water}$$
or 
$$\textrm{Fuel + Oxygen} \rightarrow \textrm{Carbon Soot + Water}$$


### Balancing combustion reactions
1. Balance tbe carbon atoms by adding the appropriate coefficient in front of $CO_2$ 
2. Balance hydrogen by writing appropriate coefficient of $H_2O$ 
3. Balance the oxygen atoms by writing the appropriate coefficient in front of $O_2$
