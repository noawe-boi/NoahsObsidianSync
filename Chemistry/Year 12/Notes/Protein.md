## Structure
### Primary Structures of protein
The overall structure or a protein (and thus its function) is based on it structure
#### Primary structure
Also known as the sequence of amino acids. 

### Secondary structure of a protein. 
The localised folding of the polypeptide. 
	Pretty much how the chains of proteins arrange themself. 
	etc. in sheets, coiled up

### Overall structure of a protein. 
Proteins fold into three-dimensional structures for two purposes
- to minimise repulsion 
and 
- maximise attraction between amino acids and with the surrounding environment.


### Hydrophobic interactions
The hydrophobic effect refers to the folding of a protein to ‘bury’ non-polar amino acids within the interior of a protein’s structure in order to shield them from water at the surface of the protein. 

Conversely, polar amino acids tend to exist on the surface of the protein so interactions with water takes place.


### How different types of [[Amino Acids]] interact
- Non-polar amino acids interact through hydrophobic interactions.
- Polar neutral amino acids interact through hydrogen bonding.
- Polar acidic and basic amino acids interact through ionic bonds, called a salt bridge.
- Cysteine amino acids interact through bonding of their sulfur atoms in a disulfide bridge

### Tertiary and Quaternary structure of proteins
The tertiary structure is the three dimensional structure made up of interactions between the secondary structures.

#### Exam Tip
Note: do NOT write "$a$ helix" or "$B$ pleated sheet" as that is incorrect. Rather than worrying about correctly drawing the a and b symbols, just write out the full name to prevent losing marks!
