### What are Conjugate acids and bases?
#### Conjugate acids
when a **basic** substance gains a proton, it **forms an acid** called the conjugate acid of a base.
#### Conjugate bases
when an **acidic** substance loses a proton, it **forms a base**, called theÂ conjugate base of an acid


### Base pairs
Each pair will contain one Bronsted Lowry (BL) acid, and one BL base.

### Conjugate pairs and $K_a$/$K_b$ ([[Chemistry Strengths of Acids and Bases]])

$$

\begin{align}K_{\mathrm a}  &= \mathrm{\dfrac{[{ B}] [H^+]}{[{ BH^+}]}} \\  &= \mathrm{\dfrac{[{ B}] [H^+]}{[{ BH^+}]}\dfrac{[{ OH^-}]}{[{ OH^-}]}}\\  &= \mathrm{\dfrac{[{ B}]}{[{ BH^+}] [OH^-]}[H^+][OH^-]}\\  &= \dfrac{1}{K_{\mathrm b}}K_{\mathrm w}  \end{align}$$

## Examples

### Example 1
Consider a strong acid $HCL$ reacting with water.
$HCL+H_2O \rightarrow H_3O^+ + Cl^-$

We can see that $HCL$ is the acid, and $H_2O$ is the base. This is because $HCL$ is donating a proton, and therefore is acting as a Bronsted Lowry acid. Because water accepts the proton, it is acting as a Bronsted Lowry base

The only difference between $H_2O$ and $H_3O$ is a $H^+$ ion, therefore these are the pair. Clearly the only difference between $HCL$ and $Cl^-$ is $H^+$ too therefore these are a pair too

Clearly $Cl^-$ is the conjugate base of the acid ($HCL$)
Clearly $H_3O$ is the conjugate acid of base $H_2O$


### Example 2
Consider reaction of weak base, ammonia, in water
$NH_3 + H_2O \rightleftharpoons NH_4 + OH^-$
Clearly $NH_3$ gains a $H^+$ ion, becoming $NH_4$ and therefore becoming the conjugate acid
Inverse for $H_2O$, therefore becoming the conjugate base.
