### Isomers of Alkynes
Isomers are possible in straight chain alkynes with ===four or more carbon atoms===. 
### Examples
Original: $CH_3 - CH_2 - C \equiv C - H$ 
Isomer: $CH_3 -C\equiv C - CH_3$
Clearly the isomer is different in terms of structure, however they have the same number of carbon and hydrogen atoms.
