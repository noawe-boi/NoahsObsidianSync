## What does $RICE$ stand for?
### R
- Ratio - Given by the balanced chemical equation

### I
- Initial - Initial Concentration in M

### C
- Change- Change that occurs
- Only occurs due to chemical reaction
- Linked to the starting ratios of the chemical equation 

### E 
- Equilibrium - Equilibrium concentration

## Making RICE table
### For Systems where you must calculate equilibrium
1. Write a balanced chemical equation
2. Convert all mole amount to concentration
	-  $C=\frac{n}{v}$
	- The volume of a container is the volume of all gases combined
3. recognize that
	- Initially there is no product, only reactants
	- the concentration of products is measured at equilibrium
3. Complete a RICE table
4. Determine $K_c$
