## What does $RICE$ stand for?
### R
Ratio - Given by the balanced chemical equation
### I
Initial - Initial Concentration in M

### C
Change- Change that occurs

### E 
Equilibrium - Equilibrium concentration

## Making  RICE table
### For Systems where you must calculate equlibrium
1. Write a balanced chemical equation
2. Convert all mole ammount to concentration
	-  $C=\frac{n}{v}$
	- The volume of a container is the volume of all gases
3. recognise that
	- Initially there is no product, only reactants
	- the concentration of products is measured at equilibrium
3. Complete a RICE table
4. Determine $K_c$
