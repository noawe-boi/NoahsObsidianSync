### What are amines?
Organic compounds containing the amino functional group.
#### Suffix
'amine'
### Primary, Secondary, Tertiary
Determined b the number of [[Alkyl]] groups bonded to the nitrogen atom.

### Naming Amines
1. Identify the alkyl group
2. place each alkyl group in alphabetical order, and use multipliers if necessary
3. ad the suffix '==amine==' to the end of the name

#### Examples
#### 1.
```smiles
CN(-C)(-C)
```
We have a nitrogen, connected to **$3$** *methane*'s.
The molecule contains three alkyl groups attached to a nitrogen, so it is a tertiary amine.
this is **tri**-*methyl*-==amine==
#### 2.
```smiles
C-C-N
```
We consider the nitrogen in the middle first. Everything revolves around the nitrogen.
Consider the cheat sheet, we have a Ethane alkane attached to the $H_2N$ group. 
Consider Ethane, remove end so its "Ethyl-amine"
