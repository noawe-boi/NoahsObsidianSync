### Stereoisomers
Stereo isomers have the same empirical formula and 2d structure, but different spacial arrangements. 

We can determine stereoisomers by first finding the [[Chiral Center]](s) of the molecule, or considering points where the rotation of the molecule is restricted (such as double bonds)

### How many stereo isomers are there?
$n(\textrm{stereoisomers})=2^n$
Where
- $n$ is the number of [[Chiral Center]]s

### Determining whether a molecule is chiral 
Consider this molecule

Clearly we have a chiral centre where each bromine is. However since there is a line of symmetry across each side of the molecule, the molecule is actually [[Achiral]]

### Types of stereo isomers
#### Geometric (cis/trans)
- When the rotation is restricted (like by a double bond)
- Same 2D connectivity but different spacial arrangement

##### Cis
###### Configuration
Both higher priority substituents are on the same side of the double bond
###### Rings
Substituents are on the same face of the ring (both up or both down)
##### Trans
###### Configuration
Both Higher priority substituents are on opposite sides of the double bond
###### Rings
Substituents are on opposite faces (one up one down)




#### Enantomers
- All [[Chiral Center]]s change with respect to another molecule
- Mirror images of one another.

These are [[Achiral]] as they are symmetrical and therefore don't have a chiral centre as the functional groups on both sides of the chiral carbon are the same time.

They are actually [[Stereoisomer#Mesocompounds]]
#### Diastereomers
- One of the [[Chiral Center]](s) has changed

2 and 4 are distereomers

#### Mesocompounds
- [[Achiral]] molecules have a plane of symmetry and therefore can be superimposed on their mirror image to show that they are actually the same molecule. 
- They may have many [[Chiral Center]]s, however they are overall [[Achiral]].  
- They are actually identical molecules.
