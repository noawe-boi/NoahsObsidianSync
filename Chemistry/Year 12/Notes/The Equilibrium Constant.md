## What is the Equilibrium Constant

The equilibrium law states that the concentration of products to the power of their coefficients divided by eh concentration of reactants to the power of their coefficients is equal to the equilibrium constant $K_c$ 

i.e, for $$aA + bB \rightleftharpoons cC + dD$$
Where A, B, C, D are concentrations, and a, b, c, d, are there coefficients
$$K_c = \frac{(C)^c \times (D)^d}{(A)^a \times (B)^b}$$


## Trends
- $Kc >>1 \implies Concentration_{products} > Concentration_{reactants}$  
- $Kc << 1 \implies Concentration_{reactants} > Concentration_{proudcts}$
- Neither $\implies Concentration_{reactatnts} \approx Concentration_{products}$
