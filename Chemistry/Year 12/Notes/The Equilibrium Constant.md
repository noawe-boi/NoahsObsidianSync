## What is the Equilibrium Constant

The equilibrium law states that the concentration of products to the power of their coefficients divided by eh concentration of reactants to the power of their coefficients is equal to the equilibrium constant $K_c$ 

i.e, for $$aA + bB \rightleftharpoons cC + dD$$
Where A, B, C, D are concentrations, and a, b, c, d, are there coefficients
$$K_c = \frac{(C)^c \times (D)^d}{(A)^a \times (B)^b}$$


## Trends
- $Kc >>1 \implies Concentration_{products} > Concentration_{reactants}$  
- $Kc << 1 \implies Concentration_{reactants} > Concentration_{proudcts}$
- Neither $\implies Concentration_{reactatnts} \approx Concentration_{products}$ 
### Effects of Changing KC

- *Temperature is the only physical change that has an effect on the $K_c$ value*
	- i.e. Changing molar concentration will not have an effect
- Reversing a equation will result in an inverse $K_c$ value
- Doubling the coefficients will square the $K_c$ value
- Halving the coefficients will result in $\sqrt{K_c}$ value
#### Example
if $N_2 + 3H_2 \leftrightharpoons 2NH_3$, $K_c = 95.6$ 
then, when reaction is reversed: $$2NH_3 \rightleftharpoons N_2+3H_2$$
$$K_c = (95.6)^{-1}$$
when coefficients are tripled
$$K_c = (95.6)^{3}$$

when coefficients are halved
$$K_c = \sqrt{(95.6)}$$

# For Systems Not in Equilibrium
## What is $Q_c$ 
For systems not in Equilibrium, use $Qc$, or the reaction quotient 
## How do you calculate $Q_c$ 
Using the same equations as using Kc
## What is $Q_c$ used for 
Used to determine which direction a reaction must proceed in order to reach equilibrium
