### What are aldehydes
#### Formula
$RCHO$
#### Functional Groups
aldehydes have a [[Carbonyl]] group on the end of the main chain (carbon number 1)
#### Naming aldehydes

1. Identify the main chain
2. omit the final letter 'e'
3. add 'al' to suffix
You do not need to indicate the position of the [[Carbonyl]] because it is always on the end of the main chain
