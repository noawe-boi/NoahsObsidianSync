## Definition
The concentration of components in an equilibrium reaction

## Conditions
- Rate of product formation = rate of reactant formation
However
- Concentration of product $\ne$ Concentration of reactant 
	- Or at least, it doesn't have to

The position of equilibrium is the ratio of product to reactant when equilibrium is reached
- "Lies to the left" $\implies$ More product than reactant
- "Lies to the right" $\implies$ more reactant than product

### States of Equalibrium
- Equilibrium can occur in many different sets of concentrations even within the same conditions
