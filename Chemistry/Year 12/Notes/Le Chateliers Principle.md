## What is Le Chatelier's Principle
It states that is an equilibrium system is subjected to a change, the system will adjust itself to oppose the effect of this change

### How does the system resist change?
#### 'shift' or 'move' to the right
- The forward reaction becomes more favored
- More products are formed than reactants

#### 'shift' or 'move' to the left
- The reverse reaction becomes more favored 
- More reactants are formed than products

### What Kinds of questions involve Le Chatelier's principle?
- Predicting system response to external change
- Predicting external change based on system response
#### logical statements involve 
1. External change
2. System Response
3. Equilibrium
