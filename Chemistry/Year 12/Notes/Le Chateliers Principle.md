## What is Le Chatelier's Principle
It states that is an equilibrium system is subjected to a change, the system will adjust itself to oppose the effect of this change

### How does the system resist change?
#### 'shift' or 'move' to the right
- The forward reaction becomes more favored
- More products are formed than reactants

#### 'shift' or 'move' to the left
- The reverse reaction becomes more favored 
- More reactants are formed than products

### What Kinds of questions involve Le Chatelier's principle?
- Predicting system response to external change
- Predicting external change based on system response
#### logical statements involve 
1. External change
2. System Response
3. Equilibrium

### Predicting the system response
1. Identify external change. Clearly state trend (increasing or decreasing one of the factors)
2. Acknowledge that the system will try and counteract the change
3. Explain what resisting the change will do in terms of increasing/decreasing concentration, temperature, pressure or volume. Should be opposite of step 1
4. Predict which way the system has to shift to achieve the effect of step 3. (for temperature identify which side is endothermic and which is exothermic)
5. Link the shift to the require effect if needed
