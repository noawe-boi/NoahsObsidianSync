## What is Le Chatelier's Principle
It states that is an equilibrium system is subjected to a change, the system will adjust itself to oppose the effect of this change

### How does the system resist change?
#### 'shift' or 'move' to the right
- The forward reaction becomes more favored
- More products are formed than reactants

#### 'shift' or 'move' to the left
- The reverse reaction becomes more favored 
- More reactants are formed than products
### Predicting the system response
1. Identify external change. Clearly state trend (increasing or decreasing one of the factors)
2. Acknowledge that the system will try and counteract the change
3. Explain what resisting the change will do in terms of increasing/decreasing concentration, temperature, pressure or volume. Should be opposite of step 1
4. Predict which way the system has to shift to achieve the effect of step 3. (for temperature identify which side is endothermic and which is exothermic)
5. Link the shift to the require effect if needed

## What Kinds of questions involve Le Chatelier's principle?
- Predicting system response to external change
- Predicting external change based on system response
#### logical statements involve 
1. External change
2. System Response
3. Equilibrium

## Representing Equilibrium systems graphically 
- Plot time on the x axis, and concentration on the y axis.
### At equilibrium
- lines will be horizontal, representing a constant
### When a Le Chateliers response is occurring
- Concentrations changing smoothly and equal/opposite change in opposite directions of reactions
### When an external change occurs
- Sharp and instantaneous change in one of all concentrations
#### When one curve changes vertically
- Change in concentration
- More of one chemical has been added
- System will respond to re-establish equilibrium

#### All gas curves change vertically
- Change in pressure or volume
- up $\implies$ more pressure
- down $\implies$ less pressure

#### All curves change smoothly
- Change in temperature
- Reactant and product curves more in opposite directions according to which side is endothermic and which is exothermic.
- Rate of change is proportional to molar ratio
