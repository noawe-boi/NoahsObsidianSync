## Definition
Like a special dipole-dipole force that is about 10 times stronger than the average one. Only forms under specific conditions though.

##  Requirements for formation
- Hydrogen atom must be covalently bonded with an F, O, or N atom 
- A lone pair of electrons in one of those F, O, or N atoms in neighbouring molecule
## Solubility
Stronger interactions between solute particles make the solute harder to dissolve.

# In Water and Ice
### Density of Ice and Water
*Ice floats on water??*

   *I thought solids were more dense than liquids!?!?!*

Inter molecular forces of $H_2O$ influence its properties

### Unusually high melting, and boiling points

This is due to
- Higher temperatures are needed to break the stronger, hydrogen bonds
### High surface tension
Inter molecular bonding is a large factor when it comes to surface tension and viscosity
