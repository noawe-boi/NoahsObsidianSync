### What is a buffer solutions
A solution that reacts **amphiprotically** to a change in pH


#### Example (sodium)
A mixture of sodium dihydrogen phosphate and sodium hydrogen phosphate is widely used in laboratories to bugger solutions at a pH of around 7. Explain how this combination of salts maintains a constant pH even when small amount of $HCL$ or $NaOH$ are added to solution. 

Consider balanced equation:
$H_2 PO_4^-+H_2O \rightleftharpoons PO0_4^{2-} + H_3O^+$

We need to explain how it maintains pH now

Consider addition of $HCL$
	$H_2 PO_4^-+H_2O +HCL \rightleftharpoons HPO_4^{2-} + H_3O^++HCL$
	This will make the pH smaller than 7. What need to happen to undo this process??
	We can consider $HCL$ as $H^+$
	$H_2 PO_4^- +H^+ \rightleftharpoons HPO_4^{2-}$
	Since there is not a temperature change, le chatliers principle indicates that increasing concentration of reactants, will then increase concentration of products. Therefore using up the $H^+$ ions, therefore increasing pH back to $\approx 7$ 
	
	
#### Example (biology)
For example - If a small amount of acid is added to the blood, the acid reacts with the bicarbonate anions:
$H_3​O^+_{(aq)}+HCO_3^−​_{(aq)}⇌H_2​CO_3​_{(aq)}+H_2​O_{(l)}$

If a small amount of base is added to the blood, the base reacts with the carbonic acid:
$OH^−_{(aq)}+H_2​CO_3​(aq)⇌HCO_3^−​_{(aq)}+H_2​O_{(l)}$
