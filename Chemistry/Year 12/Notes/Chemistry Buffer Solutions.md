### What is a buffer solutions
A solution that reacts **amphiprotically** to a change in pH


### Example (biology)
For example - If a small amount of acid is added to the blood, the acid reacts with the bicarbonate anions:
$H_3​O^+_{(aq)}+HCO_3^−​_{(aq)}⇌H_2​CO_3​_{(aq)}+H_2​O_{(l)}$

If a small amount of base is added to the blood, the base reacts with the carbonic acid:
$OH^−_{(aq)}+H_2​CO_3​(aq)⇌HCO_3^−​_{(aq)}+H_2​O_{(l)}$
