### What is [[Transesterification]]?
Exchanging an [[Ester]] with an [[Alcohol]] in order to form a new ester and alcohol. 
#### Base catalysed transesterification 
##### What is it?
The base catalysed transesterification method uses an organic oil, alcohol, and a proton accepting base catalyst. 
It is used to produce bio diesel. 
##### Advantages of base catalysed transesterification
- High yield (98%)
- Can be performed at relatively low temperatures and pressures 

##### Method
Organic oil (e.g. vegetable oil) is combined with an alcohol. The reaction is catalyzed
by a proton accepting base. The triglycerides in the vegetable oil are combined with methanol $(CH_3OH)$, and the base is usually $NaOH$ or $KOH$

###### Steps
1. Methanol is mixed with the base (say $NaOH$). $NaOH$ dissociates into $Na^+$ and $OH^-$ ions. The $OH^-$ removes a proton from methanol ($CH_3OH$) to form water and $CH_3O^-$ 
2. The mixture is added to the triglycerides at $60-70\degree C$ . The triglyceride reacts with 3 moles of methanol, and the molecule splits  

#### Lipase-catalysed transesterification
An enzyme called [[lipase]], usually a catalyst for fat (lipid) [[Hydrolysis]]. This is slower and more expensive but more environmentally friendly. Glycerol, the by-product, is easily separated
