### What is it
The carbonâ€“halogen bond in haloalkanes is polar. This polarity makes the carbon atom electron poor and susceptible to substitution reactions by reagents that have a non-bonding pair of electrons. Reagents that can substitute the halogen atom include cyanide (${CN}^-$), iodide ($I^-$), hydroxide (${OH}^-$), chloride (${Cl}^-$), ammonia (${NH}_3$), acetate (${CH}_3 {CO}^{(2-)}$), hydride ($H^-$) and methanol (${CH}_3OH$).
