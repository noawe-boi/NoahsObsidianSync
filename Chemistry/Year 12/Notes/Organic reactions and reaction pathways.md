### What are organic reactions?
[[Organic Chemsitry]] is about breaking strong covalent bonds. 
#### Types of reactions
- [[Addition Reactions]]
- [[Elimination Reaction]]
- [[Oxidation Reactions]]
- [[Reduction Reactions]]
- [[Condensation Reactions]]
- [[Substitution Reactions]]

### Chemical Test to distinguish [[Alkane]]s and [[Alkene]]s
#### The bromine methods
Adding bromine (dissolved in water or as a $1\%$ solution in carbon tetrachloride) is used as a chemical test to find if [[Hydrocarbon]]s are [[Saturated compound]]s or [[Unsaturated Compound]]s.  

##### If the color disappears
Nothing happens, the hydrocarbon is saturated

##### If the color does not disappear 
The bromine has reacted and added a bond, indicated that the hydrocarbon is unsaturated. 

### Markinovinokov's Rule

#### The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer
i.e. 
- Carbon atoms with more hydrogens will get more hydrogens
- Carbon atoms with less hydrogen atoms will not be favored, and get more halogens, etc.
