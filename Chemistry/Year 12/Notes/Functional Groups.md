### What are functional groups?
Groups of atoms attached to carbon compounds that give them characteristic reactions. 
- Double Bonds
- Triple bonds
- New group added

Functional Groups are the 'centre of reactivity'
	Alkanes are pretty unreactive. Alkenes are more reactive because they have double bonds. Therefore the functional group is located at the double bond. This is the case for all alkenes. This further applies to alkynes


### Examples
Changing functional group changes the properties of these atoms

### Why do functional groups make reactions similar
The functional group itself is prone to reacting in certain ways. It could be easily
- displaced
- bonded with
or even be inert

When the functional group is attached to a carbon chain, these properties don't just dispensary. The chain inherits these properties. Therefore for any carbon chain with the same functional group (or in the same [[Homologus Series]]), we can expect the functional group to cause the compound to react similarly to others with the same group and general formula.
