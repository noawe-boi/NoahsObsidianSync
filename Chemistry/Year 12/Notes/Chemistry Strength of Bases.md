### What is the strength of an base?
The strength of an acid is given by its degree of ionisation (*or more the lack of*) in an aqueous solution

### How do you determine the strength of an acid?
#### The general ionisation equation
$B + H_2O \rightleftharpoons BH^+ + OH^-$ 

Where
- $B$ is a base
- $BH^+$ and $OH^-$ are the products

#### Base dissociation constant ($K_b$)
$$K_a=\frac{[BH^+][OH^-]}{[B]}$$
