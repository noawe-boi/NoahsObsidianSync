## Regular
### Rules for naming
1. Locate the main chain (the longest carbon chain in the compound)
2. Name the parent chain using the prefix representing that number (find the root word)
3. Determine the suffix (ending) using functional groups
4. Number your carbon atoms from the end cloest to the functional group
	Remeber you want the first number to be as small as possible 
5. Name the side groups with their locants
6. Put the side groups in alphabetical order
7. Separate letters and numbers with a dash
8. Separate multiple numbers with a comma 
## Cyclic
- Add **cyclo** as prefix
- Assign starting carbon as the one closest to a branch
