### What is it
[[Amide]]s are synthesized from carboxylic acids and [[Amine]]s
- Reversable (like [[Esterification]])
- Has by-product of water (which comes from the [[Hydroxyl]] group)
- Naming is based around the $N$
#### Tests
The amine reactant is a weak base because it has a non-bonding pair of electrons, which can bond with hydrogen ions from water and acids about 7% of the time. **Red litmus paper can be used to monitor the reaction progress because it will turn blue if there is still amine reactant present**
### Requirements
- Heat ($>100\degree$)
### Formula
$$ \textrm{Carboxylic Acid + Amine} \rightarrow \textrm{Amide + Water}$$
