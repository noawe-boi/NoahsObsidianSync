## Definition
Form between *all* molecules
Occur instantaneously
an *attractive* force

## How are they formed?
1. They first require the formation of an instantaneous dipole (or a dipole formed by temporary uneven electron distribution)
2. The temporary dipoles induce new temporary dipoles in other molecules
3. Areas of opposite charge from other instantaneous dipoles will be attracted to each other

## Factors effecting strength 
### Size of molecules
Larger molecule $\implies$ Easier to produce a temporary dipole $\because$ More electrons
### Size of molecules
Linear molecule $\implies$ stronger dispersion forces $\because$ more surface area

### Effects of dispersion forces
Dispersion forces affect a molecules:
- Boiling point
- Melting point
- State at room temp
Yeah pretty much all the same thing ngl
