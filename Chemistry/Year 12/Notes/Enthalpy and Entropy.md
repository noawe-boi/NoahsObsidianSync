## Definition
### Enthalpy
The heat energy content of a system
#### Change in Enthalpy ($\Delta H$)
$\Delta H = H_{Products} - H_{Reactants}$

### Entropy
A measure of randomness or disorder in a system.
#### Change in Entropy ($\Delta S$)



## Trends
- Reactions will usually go in 
	- the direction with lower enthalpy
	- the direction with an increase in entropy
