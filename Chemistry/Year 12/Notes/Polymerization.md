#### Polymerization
Successive addition reactions of alkane monomers. This reaction causes monomers to join end-to-end, forming a large chain. 
Requires high heat, high pressure and catalyst. 
**Self addition reaction**
	If there are other molecules present, it will prevent the reaction from occuring
##### Formula
$$\textrm{Monomer Alkane} \rightarrow \textrm{High temp, high pressure, catalyst} \rightarrow \textrm{polymer}$$
