#### Etc
- You multiply the oxidation number by the number of molecules in the thing
	Considering $ClO_3^-\rightarrow Cl^-$, We have 3 oxygens in the first one. Therefore oxygen has a number of $-6$, therefore chlorine has a number of $+5$
- Increasing oxidation number means that has been oxidised, decreasing means reduced.
	Reduced $\rightarrow$ smaller 

#### General

- Must be written with $\pm$ before number
	- e.g. $+2$ 

- The oxidation number of hydrogen is +1 
- The net oxidation number of a neutral molecule is 0
#### Free elements ($H_2, O_2, Cu$) 
(i.e basically all gasses)
Have an oxidation number of $0$ 
#### Ions
An ion has an oxiation number equal to the charge on the ion
e.g. $Al^{3+}$ has an oxidation number of +3 
#### Periodic table overlap
##### Group 1 elements
Have an oxidation number of +1
##### Group 2 elements
Have an oxidation number of +2
#### Hydrogen
##### Hydrogen bonded with non metals
Oxidation number of +1
##### Hydrogen bonded with metals (or Boron)
Oxidation number of -1
#### Oxygen
Oxygen usually has an oxidation number of -2
	Except for when bonded with $F$ or peroxides
#### Elements in group 7 ($Cl, F, Br$)
Have an oxidation number of -1
#### Elements in group 16
have an oxidation number of -2 
#### Elements in group 15
Have an oxidation number of -3.
