### What is it
[[Amide]]s are synthesised from carboxylic acids and [[Amine]]s
- Reversible (like [[Esterification]])
- Has by-product of water (which comes from the [[Hydroxyl]] group)
- Naming is based around the $N$



#### Tests
The amine reactant is a weak base because it has a non-bonding pair of electrons, which can bond with hydrogen ions from water and acids about 7% of the time. **Red litmus paper can be used to monitor the reaction progress because it will turn blue if there is still amine reactant present**
### Requirements
- Heat ($>100\degree$)
### Formula
$$ \textrm{Carboxylic Acid + Amine} \rightarrow \textrm{Amide + Water}$$

One of the $H$ atoms from the amine and the $OH$ from the carboxylic acid join together to form water as a by-product. The amine and the carboxylic acid join where they both lost their components
