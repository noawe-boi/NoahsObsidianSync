A strong acid like $HCl$ donates its proton so readily that there is essentially no tendency for the conjugate base $Cl^–$ to re-accept a proton. Consequently, $Cl^–$ is a very weak base. A strong base like the $H^–$ ion accepts a proton and holds it so firmly that there is no tendency for the conjugate acid $H_2$ to donate a proton. Hence, $H_2$ is a very weak acid.
