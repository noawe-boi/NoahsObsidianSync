### Requirements
- Particles must collide in the correct orientation
- Particles must collide with sufficient energy or speed

if these are fulfilled, *a reaction occurs*
### Factors effecting ROR
- Surface area (more surface area $\rightarrow$ more reactions can occur at once)
- Temperature (higher particle or internal energy)
- Concentration (more particles in same area $\rightarrow$ more reactions)
- Presence of a catalyst (lowers activation energy $\rightarrow$ more reactions can occur even if they have less energy)
**Even very slow reactions can be become vigorous under the correct conditions**
e.g. Flour mills blowing up

### Expressing ROR 
ROR is expressed as amount of reactant changing per unit of time
e.g.
- 1 mole per second - 1 mol/s
- 5 grams per year - 5 g/year
