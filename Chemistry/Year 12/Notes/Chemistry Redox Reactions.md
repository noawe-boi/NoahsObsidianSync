## What are redox reactions??
Redox reactions are reactions that involve the transfer of electrons between atoms. 
These reactions convert chemical potential energy to electrical energy. 

## Reduction and Oxidation reactions
**Redox** is an abbreviation for a pair or reactions where electrons are exchanged or transferred between reactants. These are *oxidation* and *reduction*. They **cannot** occur without each other

### Oxidation
- When a chemical species loses one or more electrons

### Reduction
- When a chemical specs gains one or more electrons


### Example
$$4Na_{(s)} + O_2 \rightarrow 2Na_2O_{(s)}$$
In this example, Sodium loses and election, and oxygen gains two. This transfer results in $Na$ becoming $Na^+$, and $O$ becoming $O^{2-}$ 

**Sodium** has been **oxidised** and *oxygen* has been *reduced*


## Redox Terminology 
Redox Reactions can be remembered as the acronym
$$OILRIG$$
or:
- Oxidation
- Is
- Loss (of electrons)
- Reduction
- Is
- Gain (of electrons)


The *reducing agent* is the species that is *oxidized*
The **oxidizing agent** is the species that is **reduced**

## Predicting which reactant is reduced or oxidised 
Ionisation energy and electronegativity can be used to predicted which reactant is reduced, and which is oxidised

## Displacment reactions of metals/Single displacement reactions
### Definition
Single displacement reacitons occur whena stronger reducing agent relaces a weaker reducing agent


### Example
Consider the reaction of magnesium with zinc nitrate
$$ Zn(NO_3)_2 \; _{(aq)} + Mg_{(s)} \rightarrow Mg(NO_3)_{2 \;(aq)} + Zn_{(s)}$$

- Magnesium is a stronger reducing agent $\therefore$ it gives away elections more readily than zinc (removing it from the nitrate ion)
- This forms $Mg(NO_3)_2$ and $Zn$ 
- Therefore, $Mg$ (magnesium) has undergone oxidation
