### What is titration?
When a solution of known concentration is added to a solution of unknown concentration until they are equal in quantity.

Usually performed with [[Acid - Base pH Indicators]] in solution

#### Formula for titration
$$n=c\cdot V$$ Where:
- $n$ is the number of moles
- $c$ concentration in mol/L
- $V$ is the volume of solution that is added in L
	- Note that we don't actually have to change it to L as long as we use the same unit across both and then use mol/mL instead of mol/L
### Terminology
#### Titrant
The thing that we are adding 

#### Analyt
The thing in the breaker we are trying to analyze

### Example
#### 1
In a titration, 10mL of 2.0M Phosphoric acid reacts with 15mL of sodium hydroxide of unknown concentration. Determine the concertation of the sodium hydroxide solution

Write a balanced equation
$H_3PO_4 + 3NaOH \rightarrow Na_3 PO_4 + 3H_2O$ 
 
The ratio of $H_3PO_4$ to $3NaOH$ is $3:1$ 
Therefore $3\cdot n_{(H_3PO_4)}=n_{(NaOH)}$

We know that when all the acid uses up all of the base, titration will be achieved. i.e)$3\cdot n_{(H_3PO_4)}=n_{(NaOH)}$

For phosphoric acid, we know $V=10$ mL, $c=2.0M$ 
For sodium hydroxide, $V=15ml$, 
$\therefore 3\cdot c\cdot V = 3\cdot 10\cdot 2.0\textrm{ mol/ml}=15\cdot x \textrm{ mol/ml}$ 
$\therefore 60=15x$
$\therefore x=\frac{60}{15}=4.0M$
Therefore the concentration of the sodium hydroxide is $\approx 1.3M$
