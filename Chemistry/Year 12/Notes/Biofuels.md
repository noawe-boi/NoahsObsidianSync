### Biodiesel

#### Synthesis of biodiesel 
##### Base catalyzed transesterification method
Exchanges an ester with an alcohol to form a new ester, and a new alcohol. 

Organic oil (e.g. vegetable oil) is combined with an alcohol. The reaction is catalyzed
by a proton accepting base. The triglycerides in the vegetable oil are combined with methanol $(CH_3OH)$, and the base is usually $NaOH$ or $KOH$

###### Steps
1. Methanol is mixed with the base (say $NaOH$). $NaOH$ dissociates into $Na^+$ and $OH^-$ ions. The $OH^-$ removes a proton from methanol ($CH_3OH$) to form water and $CH_3O^-$ 
2. The mixture is added to the triglycerides at $60-70\degree C$ . The triglyceride reacts with 3 moles of methanol, and the molecule splits
