## What is the electrochemical series
- Redox Reactions convert chemical potential energy into electrical energy
- The ability for elements, ions, or molecules to gain or lose electrons can be determined from the **electrochemical series**

### What do the numbers mean??
Bigger number $\rightarrow$ More likely and stronger ability to 'suck up' or gain an electron
Smaller number (or negative) $\rightarrow$ less likely and lesser ability to 'suck up' or gain an electron

## Half  Equations 
The chemical equations in the table (e.g. $Li^{+} + e^-$) are called half equation
 
 - $E^0$ is the potential energy of the reaction of each half equation
	 - defined under standard concentration (1mol/L) against standard hydrogen electrode with $E^0 = 0\textrm{V}$ 


- Half Equations are reversable

electrons on left hand side of half equation $\implies$ reduction of half equation as the species gains electrons
$\therefore$ 
electrons on right hand side of half equation $\implies$ oxidation of half equation as the species loses electrons

To consider which reaction will occur we use the **electrochemical series table**
## Using the Electrochemical Series Table

**Lower** $E^0$ $\implies$ Stronger **oxidizing** agent/Weaker reducing agent

*Higher* $E^0 \implies$ Stronger *reducing* agent/Weaker oxidizing agent


### Rules for using the electrochemical series
1. **A reaction will occur between an oxidant and a reductant IF the oxidant is lower in the series**
2. To write the net redox reaction 
	1. Write down the half equation for oxidant
	2. Write down oxidant half equation
3. WIP


## Worked Example
Predict whether a reaction will occur between iron (II) nitrate $(Fe(NO_3)_2$) and:
- magnesium metal
- lead (II) nitrate
