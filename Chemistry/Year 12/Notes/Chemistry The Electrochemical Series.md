## What is the electrochemical series
- Redox Reactions convert chemical potential energy into electrical energy
- The ability for elements, ions, or molecules to gain or lose electrons can be determined from the **electrochemical series**

### What do the numbers mean??
Bigger number $\rightarrow$ More likely and stronger ability to 'suck up' or gain an electron (reduce)
Smaller number (or negative) $\rightarrow$ less likely and lesser ability to 'suck up' or gain an electron (oxidise)

If the reduced element is lower in the series then the reductant (reducing agent) will oxidize. 
## Half  Equations 
![[Chemistry Half Equations]]

### Example



## Using the Electrochemical Series Table

**Lower** $E^0$ $\implies$ Stronger **oxidizing** agent/Weaker reducing agent

*Higher* $E^0 \implies$ Stronger *reducing* agent/Weaker oxidizing agent


### Rules for using the electrochemical series
1. **A reaction will occur between an oxidant and a reductant IF the oxidant is lower in the series**
2. To write the net redox reaction 
	1. Write down the half equation for oxidant
	2. Write down oxidant half equation
3. WIP


### Worked Example
Predict whether a reaction will occur between iron (II) nitrate $(Fe(NO_3)_2$) and:
- magnesium metal
- lead (II) nitrate

## Assigning oxidation states
### To tell if something is oxidised or reduced:
See the oxidation number:
- If the number is **higher** 
	- then it has been **oxidised**, 
- if it is ***lower*** 
	- then it has been ***reduced***
or
se the half equation method
### Rules for oxidation numbers
![[Chemistry Rules for oxidation numbers]]
## Worked Example
#### 6.2A 
##### Determine the oxidation state of a magnesium ion

$Mg^{2+}$, charge is $2+$ $\therefore$ oxidation number is $+2$ 

#### 6.2B 
##### Determine the oxidation state of chlorine gas

$Cl_2$ has a charge of $0$, $\therefore$ oxidation number is $0$ 

#### 6.2C 
##### Determine the oxidation state of all the elements in a 
water molecule and confirm the oxidation state of water

since it is a free agent, net oxidation number is $0$
$H_2$ has an oxidation number of $+1$ 
Since net oxidation number is $0$, $O$ must be $-2$

#### 6.2D
##### Determine the oxidation states of all the elements in dichromate ($Cr_2O_7^{2-}$)

Overall oxidation number is the same as charge: $-2$ 

Oxygen is going to be easier to figure out

Charge of oxygen is $2-$. Therefore overall charge due to oxygen is going to be $-2*7 = -14$. 

Therefore $Charge(Cr_2) + Charge(O_7) = -2$
sub in $Charge(O_7)=-14$ and bring to other side

Therefore $Charge(Cr_2) = -2+14=+12$
