## What is a half equation
Separate equations containing just the loss and then just the gain of electrons

When we combine the half equations that make up a reaction:
- Spectator ions disappear
- The loss and gain of electrons match
### Example
$$\textrm {substance} + \textrm{electrons} = \textrm{another substance}$$


## General rules
### Half Equations

The chemical equations in the table (e.g. $Li^{+} + e^-$) are called half equations
	Represent redox reactions in terms of reduction and oxidation reactions that make it up


 - $E^0$ is the potential energy of the reaction of each half equation
	 - defined under standard concentration (1mol/L) against standard hydrogen electrode with $E^0 = 0\textrm{V}$ 


- Half Equations are reversible
### Spectator ions
Ions that do not take part in the reaction. 
	We do not need to include these in half equations
### Electrons
electrons on left hand side of half equation $\implies$ reduction of half equation as the species gains electrons
$\therefore$ 
electrons on right hand side of half equation $\implies$ oxidation of half equation as the species loses electrons

### Considering which reaction will ocur
To consider which reaction will occur, use the **electrochemical series table**

## Under Acidic Conditions
### Steps
1. Balance all elements except oxygen and hydrogen
2. Balance oxygen by adding water molecules
3. Balance hydrogen by adding hydrogen ions
4. Balance the charge by adding electrons
