### What are they
Enzymes are proteins that catalyse chemical reactions in living organisms. 
	Their structure is essential for their function as biological catalysts because many enzymes have an active site that is specific for one substrate.

### Properties of enzymes 
- They have an active site. When a substrate joins with it the joined structure is called an enzyme-substrate complex
- They increase rate of reaction by lowering activation energy, leading to more successful particle interactions and formation of product. 
- They do not get used up
