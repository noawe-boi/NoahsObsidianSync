## Claim
Explore the chemical synthesis of a biofuel produced from algae and its comparisons with existing fuel sources

### Bio-fuel
Bio-gasoline


### Existing Fuel Source
Petroleum



## Background
### Claim 


### Research question


### Categories of comparison
#### Synthesis process and emissions during it
Talk about catalytic cracking (distillation) https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/oil-and-petroleum-products/refining-crude-oil-the-refining-process.php

Both conventional and 'bio' gasoline are produced via distillation of oils.
