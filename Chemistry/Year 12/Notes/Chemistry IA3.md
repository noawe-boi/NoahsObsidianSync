## Claim
Explore the chemical synthesis of a biofuel produced from algae and its comparisons with existing fuel sources

### Bio-fuel
Bio-gasoline


### Existing Fuel Source
Petroleum



## Background
### Claim 


### Research question


### Categories of comparison
#### Synthesis process and emissions during it
Talk about catalytic cracking (distillation) https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/oil-and-petroleum-products/refining-crude-oil-the-refining-process.php

Both conventional and 'bio' gasoline are produced via distillation of oils.

##### [[general analysis of algae fuels (short).pdf]]
##### Cool flow chart showing production steps

### [[biovasoline production.pdf]]
Page 3: Graphs showing how higher temperature results in better yield during the process. More energy is therefore required to 'upgrade' materials. 

Page 5: The total hydrocarbon contents in the
oil phase at 400 °C/1 MPa, 400 °C/2 MPa, and 400 °C/3 MPa
were above 97%

Page 2: Describes how the addition of ethanol improves cracking performance

Page "26": Makes good points about how algae does not compete with traditional agriculture.
#### Energy content/Chemical Make up (and vehicle compatibility)

##### [[indianpaper.pdf]]
This paper does not even distinguish between regular gasoline and biogasoline. It seems their makeup is similar enough that the deviation in combustion characteristics is smaller than that of different regular gasoline blends.
#### Emissions
