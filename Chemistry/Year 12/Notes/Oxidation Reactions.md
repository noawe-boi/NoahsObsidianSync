### Oxidation
Oxidation is the loss of hydrogen atoms, or the gain of oxygen atoms. Must occur in conjunction with [[Reduction Reactions]]. 

#### Oxidation of primary alcohols
![[Primary alcohol]]

Oxidation of primary alcohols involve the loss of two hydrogen atoms to form an aldehyde. 
Further oxidation of the aldehyde forms [[Carboxylic Acid]]
Requires warm solution ($50\degree$) with $K_2Cr_2O_7$ or $KMnO_4$ that has been acidified with $H_2 SO_4$ 
##### Formula 
$$\textrm{Primary Alcohol} \rightarrow K_2CrO_7, H_2 SO_4, 50\degree \rightarrow \textrm{carboxylic acid}$$

TODO

#### Oxidation Secondary alcohols
![[Secondary Alcohols]]

Causes loss of two hydrogens to form a keytone. the keytone cannot be further oxidized. 
Requires warm solution $70\degree$, $K_2Cr_2O_7$ that has been acidified with $H_2SO_4$. 


#### Oxidation of tertiary alcohols
not possible :(


### Oxidation of alkanes and alchols by combustion
