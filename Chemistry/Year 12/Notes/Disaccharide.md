### What are they?
Disaccharides are simple sugars made from two monosaccharides in a condensation polymerisation reaction.
#### How do they form?
When the [[Hydroxyl]] group of two [[Monosaccharide]]s join to form $H_2O$, and form a bond between the two sugar molecules, with oxygen in the middle

### Types of disaccarides
#### Lactose
