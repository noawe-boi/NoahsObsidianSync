### What is it?
The skeleton of a plant. 
[[Polysaccharide]] made from [[Glucose]] units. 
	[[Glucose]] monomers are joined through $\beta -1-4-\textrm{glycosidic linkages}$ 

- Insoluble in water, hard to digest (indigestible in most cases)

### Structure
Made up of $\beta$-[[Glucose]] in straight chains. When these chains are close, the alternating $OH$ and $CH_2OH$ groups form hydrogen bonds with each other. This makes it very hard to break down. 

In addition to this, cellulose forms microfibrils, which then form fibres. This makes it very strong.
