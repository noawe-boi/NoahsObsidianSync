### What are isomers?

Molecules that have the same molecular formula, but different structural formulas due to atoms being attached to different atoms.
	e.g. Butane ($C_4H_{10}$) can be drawn in two ways

#### Double bonds
- Double bonds add rigidity to molecules, therefore increasing the probability of isomers occuring. 
### Structural/Constitutional Isomers 
Structural isomers have the same emperical formula ($X_n Y_z$), but differnet structure 
#### Example 
Consider some structural isomers of butene ($C_4 H_8$)
