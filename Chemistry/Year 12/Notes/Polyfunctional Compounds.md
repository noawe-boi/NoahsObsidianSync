### What are polyfunctional compounds
- Many compounds have multiple functional groups present
	These are called [[Polyfunctional Compounds]]
- Only one functional group is represented in teh molecules suffix, this is known as the [[Principal Functional Group]]

### Examples
```smiles
C(=O)CCC(=O)CO
```
Consider this skeletal diagram
Clearly this is $CCOCCCOCOH$

The acid is going to be on "Carbon number 1", which is on the left in this case.
There are clearly 5 carbons in the main chain so its going to be "pentane-"
Since it is an acid its "Pentatonic Acid"
There is an oxygen attached to the fourth carbon so its going to be 4-oxo-pentanoic-acid
