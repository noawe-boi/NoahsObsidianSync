## What are equilibrium reactions?
 Reaction can go both ways until a balance has been reached
Its easier for a reaction to go one way, than another 

![[Equalibrum example 1]]

## Collision Theory 
![[Collision Theory - Rate of Reaction]]


## Equilibrium

### General Applications
#### Nature
Equilibrium reactions often occur in the human body, atmosphere and hydrosphere

#### Application industries
- Food industry
- Industrial chemistry
*These industries want the most yield possible* (without destroying material)
Could they use collision theory to generate more yield?



![[Arrhenius Law]]

## Examples
Nitrogen and Hydrogen to create 
$N_2 + 3H_2 \rightleftharpoons 2NH_3$
