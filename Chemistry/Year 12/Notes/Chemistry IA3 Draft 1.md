## Note for Mr Sonter
Hey Mr Sonter, 

Don't expect this to be coherent, its mostly just gathered sources. 
I believe I mentioned to you in class that I have been putting this assignment off due to impending maths exams, and the physics IA3 I just submitted yesterday. 

That is to say, I'm not concerned if you don't have much to say about this. I understand there is not much to provide feedback on. 

Kind regards, Noah

Explore the chemical synthesis of a biofuel produced from agae and its comparison with existing fuel sources

### What are algal fuels?

#### Why are algal fuels being investigated?

Algal fuels are considered 'Third Generation' biofuels, developed to improve the viability of biomass derived fuels at large scale. Third generation fuels are derived from aquatic biomass, and therefore do not compete with traditional land based agriculture. Another advantage is reduced waste products due to lack of cellulose and fibrous materials. These fuels require more water than their predecessors, but can grow in high salinity environments, like the ocean.

#### What fuels are created by algae
While third generation fuel sources can processed into ethanol, similarly to maize or sugar cane, their high oil and lipid content allows them to be refined into previously impractical fuel options. 
Biogasoline is one of these, and is touted as a 'drop in replacement' for unleaded gasoline. 


##### Well what is biogasoline?
Very low production at the moment, may not be cost effective without advancements in the industry. 
### Research question
How do does the collection and cracking processes differ between synthesis of gasoline and biogasoline, and how do the final products differ.  

## Categories of comparison
### Synthesis process and emissions during it

biofuel:
algae -> pyrolysis/cracking (Converts it into hydrocarbons) -> Biogasoline 

#### Starting products (Chemical make up)
##### Bio Oil
###### How is it produced
[[curent status and future applications.pdf]]

While natural cultivation was used initially due to its low capital cost, artificial cultivation is more viable for fuel production on industrial scale. Environmental conditions are controlled using closed loop systems and key consumables, notably $CO_2$, water, and nutrients, are dispersed throughout the system as as required. The system itself can take the form of either 'raceways' or tube, however both fundamentally do the same thing; circulate algae from storage into a light rich environment so that photosynthesis occurs, then back into storage. Photosynthesis allows the algae to 'capture' the carbon from the $CO_2$ bubbled into the system, or from the open air, while simultaneously releasing the oxygen attached to it. As the algae grows and reproduces, carbon will accumulate in the system in the form of glucose, and within the oils that algae produce to store energy long term. 

Dried algal biomass has a high content of these oils, and has potential to be fermeted, pyrolysed, or processed in a number of other ways. Pyrolysis is currently a prominsing technique 




###### Processing/Synthesis
Bio oil is extracted from algal biomass using pyrolyis 
Pyrolysis is decomposing a material by heating it in an inert enviroment, where combustion cannot occur. (https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/wyndmoor-pa/eastern-regional-research-center/docs/biomass-pyrolysis-research-1/what-is-pyrolysis/)

##### Crude oil
###### How is it produced?
**Briefly explain how it is pumped out from the ground and non renewable**

###### Proccessing/Refinery
##### Table Comparing bio-oil to crude oil

**Pyrolysis Oil**

- Produced through pyrolysis, a thermochemical process that heats organic materials to 400–800°C in the absence of oxygen.
- The process breaks down complex molecules into smaller ones, resulting in a liquid known as pyrolysis oil or bio-oil.
- Contains a high proportion of oxygenated compounds such as acids, aldehydes, and phenols.
- Chemically unstable due to its composition.
- Has a lower energy density compared to crude oil because of its high oxygen content.

**Crude Oil**

- Formed naturally over geological time from the decomposition of organic matter under high pressure and temperature.
- Extracted from underground reservoirs through drilling.
- Composed primarily of hydrocarbons.
- More chemically stable than pyrolysis oil.
- Has a higher energy density due to its lower oxygen content.

#### Cracking (Transformation)

***pyrolysis of alkanes is also named as cracking**.*

Talk about catalytic cracking (distillation) https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/oil-and-petroleum-products/refining-crude-oil-the-refining-process.php

Both conventional and 'bio' gasoline are produced via distillation of oils.

Page "26": Makes good points about how algae does not compete with traditional agriculture.

#### Carbon "neutral"
CO2 absorbed is actually just re-emitted when it is burnt, however this is still better than just releasing carbon with fossil fuels. 






### Energy content/Chemical Make up (and vehicle compatibility)

page 8: Table comparing caloric values and energy within we well as physical properties of gasoline and biogasoline
![[Pasted image 20250708151954.png]]
##### [[indianpaper.pdf]]
This paper does not even distinguish between regular gasoline and biogasoline. It seems their makeup is similar enough that the deviation in combustion characteristics is smaller than that of different regular gasoline blends.


### Cost
[[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biteb.2021.100901]]
For biogasoline, this paper claims that in the best case, it costs about 6 USD/GGE (Gallon gasoline equivalent)
So for the same amount of energy in one gallon of gasoline, it costs 6 USD rather than 3.167 USD (20/7/2025)
https://gasprices.aaa.com/

This is currently roughly double the average cost of fuel in the US, and this is just production cost
