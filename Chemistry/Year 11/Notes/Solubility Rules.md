1. All nitrate ($NO_2-$) salts **are soluble**
2. Most salts of $Na^+$,$K^+$ and $NH_4^+$ **are soluble**
3. Most Chloride ($Cl^-$)salts are soluble; except $BaSO_4$, $PbSO_4$ and $CaSO_4$ 
4. Most hydroxides ($OH^-$) salts are soluble; important

## What are solubility rules
- Shortcuts or rules to predict what will dissolve
- Lists which ions are soluble and insoluble

## How are they useful?
- Used to determine whether a reaction will result in a product in precipitate or solid form
- Can be used to determine ions present in unknown solutions though precipitation tests
