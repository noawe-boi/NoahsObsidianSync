Properties of Metalloids

  

- Electronegativity and ionization energy intermediate between that of metals and nonmetals
    
- May possess a metallic luster
    
- Variable density, hardness, conductivity, and other properties
    
- Often make good [semiconductors](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-a-semiconductor-1991409)
    
- Reactivity depends on the nature of other elements in the reaction
    

  
  

  
  

  
  

Properties of Nonmetals

-  Halogens and noble gases are nonmetals, although they have their groups, too.
    
- High ionization energy
    
- High electronegativity
    
- Poor electrical and [thermal conductors](https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-conductor-in-science-605845)
    
- Form brittle solids
    
- Little if any metallic luster
    
- Readily gain electrons
    

  

  

  

Properties of Halogens

  

Halogens and noble gases are nonmetals, although they have their groups, too. 

  
  

The halogens exhibit different physical properties from each other but do share chemical properties.

- Extremely high electronegativity
    
- Very reactive
    
- Seven valence electrons, so elements from this group typically exhibit a -1 oxidation state
    

Properties of Noble Gasses

  

Halogens and noble gases are nonmetals, although they have their groups, too.

  
The noble gases have:

- Complete valence electron shells
    
- Unreactive
    
- Very low [electronegativity](https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-electronegativity-604347) or electron affinity.
