## TECH FREE 
- Graphs of logarithmic functions and we have to define the translations

- Differentiate functions polynomials exponentials (with product and quotient rule)

- differentiating trig where we have fractions with trig on top and bottom

- integrals of polynomials, integral of chain rule polynomials (integral or something to the power)

- sketching a more complex combination of trig (its on the sheet that he said doesn't matter) (labelling co-ordinants of local maximum and end points)

## TECH ACTIVE
### complex familiar
- exponential equation and we are dealing with decay. finding times and stuff

 - modelling population and finding when certain criteria are met 

- analytically (show the process during it) determine the area bounded by two curves. 

- without use of calculator find the value of a definite integral

- without the use of a calculator find the given A value of an integral (From where do I need to integrate to get this result) then check result using calculator. 

### complex familiar
- modelling something with trig (we are given the equation). then calculate when a certain criteria is met.
