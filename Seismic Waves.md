Waves produced by the earths movement
### P Waves
- P Waves are **longitudinal**l i.e. the ground shakes in the direction of the wave
- First to be detected by seismic stations
- Travel though the earths core. 

### S Waves
- S Waves are **transverse**
- They travel at 1/2 speed of **P Waves**

### Surface waves
- Travel along the surface of the earth of just below it
- Caused by P and S Waves
- slower than both p and s waves
- have rolling/side to side movements
