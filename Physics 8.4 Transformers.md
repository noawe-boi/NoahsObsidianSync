### Definitions
Mutual Induction: the production of an EMF (electromagnetic force) in a circuit by a change in current in an adjacent circuit that is linked to the first through their magnetic fields. 


*Recall that*
EMF = $\frac{n \delta \epsilon}{\delta t}$
*Transformers modelled by*
$\frac{V_p}{V_s} = \frac{N_p$
