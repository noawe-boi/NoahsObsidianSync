### Definitions
Mutual Induction: the production of an EMF (electromagnetic force) in a circuit by a change in current in an adjacent circuit that is linked to the first through their magnetic fields. 


*Recall that*
EMF = $\frac{n \delta \epsilon}{\delta t}$
*Transformers modelled by*
$\frac{V_p}{V_s} = \frac{n_p}{n_s}$
Where:
$V_p$ is the voltage in the primary coil
$n_p$ is the number of turns in the primary coil
$V_s$ is the voltage in the secondary coil
$n_s$ is the number of turns in the secondary coil 


### Step up transformer
Increases the voltage 
$n_p < n_s$
$\therefore V_p < V_s$
More turns in secondary than in primary
### Step Down Transformer
$n_p > n_s$
$\therefore V_p  > V_s$
More turns in the primary in the secondary
