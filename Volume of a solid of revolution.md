#### Volume of a solid of revolution
For the region bounded by the curve $y=f(x)$, the lines $x=a$ and $y=b$ and the $x$-axis
$$V=\pi \int ^b_a \left( f\left(x\right)\right)^2 dx$$

For the region bounded by curve $x=f(y)$, the lines $y=a$ and $y=b$ and the $y$ axis:
$$V=\pi \int _a ^b (f(y))^2 dy$$

For a region bounded by two curves
$V=\pi\int ^b_a (f(x))^2-(g(x))^2dx$
or 
$V=\pi \int ^b _a (f(y))^2 - (g(y))^2 dy$
