## Newtons Law of gravitation
### Finding the gravitational attraction between 2 objects
The force between 2 objects (gravitationally) can be defined as:
$$F_g=\frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r^2}$$
or 
$$F_{g}={\frac{GMm}{r^2}}$$
Where:
- $F_{g}$ is the force of gravity
- $m_{1}$ is the mass of the first object
- $m_{2}$ is the mass of the second object
- $r$ is the radius between $m_1$ and $m_2$ 
Therefore increasing mass either of $m_{1}$ or $m_2$ will increase $F_{g}$

#### Note:
This only works when your radius is larger than the body you are measuring. 
### Comparison to attraction between charged particles
The force between 2 charged particles can be defined as
$$F=\frac{kq_{1}q_{2}}{r^2}$$



### Finding the gravitational field strength an object emits
The gravitational field strength an object emits can be expressed as 
$$g=\frac{GM}{r^2}$$
Where:
- $r$ is the radius between the objects
- $g$ is the gravitational field. 

### $F_g$'s proportionality
$$F_{G}\propto \frac{1}{r^2}$$
Consider r=2r
$$\frac{1}{(2r)^2} = \frac{1}{2^2r^2}=\frac{1}{4r^2}=\frac{1}{4}F_{g}$$
