## pH
$pH = -\log_{10}[H^+]$ 

### What is pH
pH is a measurement of the concentration of $H^+$ (Hydrogen) ions dissolved or dissociated into solution

### Why is pH useful?
A means of taking very large numbers, the concentration of $H^+$, and making it easy to understand
### Example
*Find pH of $[H^+]=0.0123M \; HCL$*
Since $HCL$ literally has $H^+$ in it, $pH = -\log(0.0123)\approx 1.91$

## pOH
$pOH=-\log [OH^-]$
$pH + pOH = 14$
### What is pOH
pOH is a measurement of the concentration of $OH$ (hydroxide) ions in solution.
### Example
Consider the $pH$ of $0.123M$ of $NaOH$
$pOH = -\log[0.0123] = 1.91$
$\therefore pH = 14-pOH = 14-1.91 = 12.09$ 



## Examples
### 4a

A pure sulfuric acid is a covalent liquid. is dissolves into water to form a strong acid solution. Hydrogen fluoride is a covalent gas. it dissolves water to form hydrofluoric acid, a weak acid. Write equations for the ionisation of these two solutions.

$$H_2SO_4 + 2H_2O \rightarrow 2H^3 O^+ + SO^{-2}$$
$$HF+H_2O \rightleftharpoons H^2O + F^-$$
This is an equilibrium reaction because it only partially dissociates. 

The only way to tell whether it is a strong acid or not is whether it completely dissociates into water, only going one way like in the first equation, or whether it only partially dissociates and forms an equilibrium equation.

### 5a
Calculate the pH of a 0.065 mol/L solution of hydrobromic acid, a strong acid

$$pH = -log[H^+]$$
$\therefore pH=-log_{10}(0.065)\approx1.187$

Since it is a strong acid, we know all of it dissociates, therefore we know the $[H^+]=[HBr]$ 


### 5b
The pH of a 0.037 mol/L solution of hydrofluoric acid, calculate the degree of ionisation of the acid in this solution

We cant remember what the degree of ionisation is... Apparently its something to do with equilibrium constant ($K_c$ )

$pH = -log[H^+] = 2.32$
$\therefore [H^+] = 10^{-2.32} \approx 0.0047$
Now we can see that the theoretical answer. Now to find the degree of ionisation we use $\frac{actual}{theoretical}*100$ 

$\frac{0.0047}{0.037}*100\approx12.7\%$

Therefore $12.7\%$ of the $H^+$ ions dissociate
