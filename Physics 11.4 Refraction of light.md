### Definition
Refraction is the bending of light as it changes medium.
This is caused by the change in density between the mediums. 

- More dense = slower speed of light

![[Physics 11.4 Refraction digram]]

- $i = \theta$ (incident angle)
- $r = \theta$ (refracted angle)
- $i > r$ if $n_1 < n_2$

### Example 11.4.1
 $n=\frac{c}{v}$ 
 $=\frac{3.00*10^8}{2.25*10^8}$$=
