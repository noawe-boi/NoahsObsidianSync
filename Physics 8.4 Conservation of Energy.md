## What is Mechanical Energy

Mechanical Energy is the sum of an objects potential and kinetic energies
i.e. $$E_m = E_k + E_p$$

## The law of conservation of energy states

## Types of Collisions
### Elastic Colisions

### In-Elastic Collisions

## Finding Momentum
Look at the formula sheet you egg head!

However, these equations unaltered cannot help us find momentum in 2 dimensional scenarios

## Efficiency Note:
$$\textrm{Efficiency} = \frac{output}{input} * 100$$
