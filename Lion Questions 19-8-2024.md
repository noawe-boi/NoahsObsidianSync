1. How did Saroo's journey impact his understanding of family
At the beginning of his journey, Saroo's family are his birth family. His Birth mother, sister, Shekila, and brother, Guddu, are all he knows family to be, and he relies on them heavily to feed and care for him. As Saroo grew up, he became more independent and started taking care of his sister, Shekila. 

However, once Saroo becomes lost, his perception of family dissolves under the weight of his situation. He becomes much more independent and must rely on himself to find food and a safe place to sleep. By time, he is given the opportunity to be adopted during his time at nava djetum, the chances of finding a new family that will love him seem higher than the chances of finding his birth family.

While Saroo does love his family in Australia, he can't help but feel something is missing. He feels out of place knowing that his birth family might still not have closure.
