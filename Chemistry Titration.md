### What is titration
When a solution of known concentration is added to a solution of unknown concentration until they are equal in quantity.

#### Formula for titration
$$n=c\cdot V$$ Where:
- $n$ is the number of moles
- $c$ concentration in mol/L
- $V$ is the volume of solution that is added in L
### Terminology
#### Titrant
The thing that we are adding 

#### Analyt
The thing in the breaker we are trying to analyze 

### Example
#### 1
In a titration, 10mL of 2.0M Phosphoric acid reacts with 15mL of sodium hydroxide of unknown concentration. Determine the concertation of the sodium hydroxide solution

We know that when all the acid uses up all of the base, titration will be achieved, and $n=n$ 

For phosphoric acid, we know $V=10$ mL, $c=2.0M$ 
For sodium hydroxide, $V=15ml$, 
$\therefore c\cdot V = 10\cdot 2.0=15\cdot x$ 
$\therefore 20=15x$
$\therefore x=\frac{20}{15}=\frac{4}{3}M$
Therefore the concentration of the sodium hydroxide is $\approx 1.3M$
