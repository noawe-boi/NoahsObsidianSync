### Definition(s)
Magnetic Flux: A measurement of the total field that passes through a given area. Measured in 'weber' 
Magnetic Flux Density: the strength of a magnetic field of number of field lines per unit area (B)



### Flux through a loop perpendicular to the field. 
Magnetic field strength = flux density, i.e.
$1T = 1Wb$/$m^2$
If one arrow was used to represent a single line of flix with a strenth of 1Wb, then 4 arrows flowing through an are of 1$m^2$ would have a flux density of 4$Wb/m^2$
