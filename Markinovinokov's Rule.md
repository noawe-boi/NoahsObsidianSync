### Markinovinokov's Rule
For the preivous examples, the [[Alkene]]s were symmetrical.
	i.e. it didnt matter which carbon atoms gets the hydrogen atom and which gets the halogen
In asymetrical [[Alkene]]s, it is no longer random. 
	Hyrdogen atoms are more liekly to bond with a carbon atom with mor ehydrogens, halogens are more likely to bond with carbon atoms with fewer hyrdogens
