### Forced Confessions

The police used primitive interrogation tactics that broke the person being interrogated down to the point of looking for a way out. While the boys did confess to the crime of raping the jogger, These confessions were not true. 

During individual questioning, the boys and their parents were told their rights and that they could be provided a lawyer if they asked, they were all manipulated into not speaking up and asking for one. 

This was a point argued in the lawsuit by Colin Moore (Korey's Lawyer) but it was not effective. (1:26:04)
