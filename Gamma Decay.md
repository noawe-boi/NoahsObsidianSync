### When does this occur
When the nucleus has too much energy to reach a stable configuration. 
Just a way of getting rid of excess energy. 




### What is ejected
Pure energy, just electromagnetic waves. 
The purest form of [[Ionising Radiation]]


### Danger level
#### Ionisation ability
*VERY HIGH*

### Effect of this



### Notation
#### Showing a nucleus has too much energy
Consider $^x_yEl$
With excess energy, becomes $^x_yEl^*$
(we add "\*")
$^x_yEl^*\rightarrow^x_yEl+^0_0\gamma$
#### Gamma particle
- $^0_0 \gamma$

### Examples
