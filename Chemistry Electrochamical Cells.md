### What is an electrochemical cell?
By separating the oxidizing and reducing agents and instead connecting them with a wire, 
#### Galvanic Cells
A galvanic cell converts *chemical energy to electrical energy* from **spontaneous** redox reactions

##### Electrodes
- May Contain an inert electrode
- If reactive, electrode may deteriorate throughout the reaction or have product deposited on it 
##### Anode
The electrode where oxidation occurs
##### Cathode
The electrode where reduction occurs 

#### Electrolytic cell
An electrochemical cell that converts *electrical energy to chemical energy* from **non-spontaneous** redox reactions
