![[RIght hand rule 2 example 2]]


**Use the left hand for negative charges!**


### For Charged Particles
$F=Bqv*sin(\theta)$
Where:
- B is the strength of the field
- q is the strength of the charge
- v is the velocity of the particle
- $\theta$ is the angle between v and magnetic field

### For Current Carrying Wires
![[rhr diagram 4]]

$F=BIL*sing(\theta)$
Where
- B is the strength of the field
- q is the strength of the charge
- v is the velocity of the particle
- $\theta$ is the angle between wire and magnetic field
