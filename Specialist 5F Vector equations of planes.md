### Foundational Concepts

#### Domain and range on the  $x-y$ plane
We can reach any point in the $x-y$ plane with a linear combinations of the vectors $\hat{j}$, and $hat{j}$. 
#### Vector normal 
The vector $\perp$ to $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$
#### Cross product

### Big ideas and concepts

#### Domain of any plane
We can reach any point in a given plane with a linear combination of two (non parallel) vectors in the plane
#### Defining planes
A plane can be defined by the normal to the plane, and a point on the plane.
	We need the normal, and a point to give the height of the plane

### Vocab and definitions
#### Vector equation of a plane

$\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{n} = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{n}$ 
Where
- $\mathbf{r} = x\hat{i} + y\hat{j} + z{\hat{k}}$ (Vector from origin to any point on the plane.)
- $\mathbf{n}$ is the normal to the plane 
- $\mathbf{a}$ Is a position vector of a point on the plane

#### Cartesian equation
$ax+by+cz=d$ 
*note:* $d=\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{n}$


### Procedures
