To overcome the electrostatic repulsive forces between protons and keep the nucleus stable, strong nuclear forces are required. 

*Holds nucleus together despite electromagnetic forces acting against it*

This is why protons and neutrons can come together in the nucleus despite their inert or repulsive electrostatic forces. In fact, **adding more neutrons will increase strong nuclear forces**, like how adding more mass will increase gravity. However, *after some time, there will be too many particles for a stable configuration to be achieved*.

#### Degradation of strong nuclear forces over distance
If you consider light, it decreases in intensity over distances using the inverse square law. 

Strong nuclear forces are extremely strong when particles are very close together, however increasing the distance slightly causes almost complete loss of force.
