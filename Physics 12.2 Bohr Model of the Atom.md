Created when Plank's model was applied to Rutherford's nuclear model. 

### Bohr's Assumptions
1. Electrons in an atom must exist in stationary states
2. The transition between these states absorbs or emits electromagnetic radiation.

![[Hydrogen spectrum]]
3. Each state has a fixed [[Angular Momentum]] and energy.  


![[Angular Momentum]]


## Example 1
Calculate the angular momentum for first and second energy levels of a hydrogen atom
$L=\frac{nh}{2\pi}$
$L=\frac{6.626*10^{-24}}{2\pi}$
$L=1.055*10^{-34} kgm^2/s$



For n=2
$L=\frac{2(6.626*10^{-24})}{2\pi}$
$L=2.109*10^{-34} kgm^2/s$



## Energy levels

![[Balmer Equation]]


More energy required at ground state than higher state $\because$ Closer to nucleus $\implies$ more force pulling in atom
### Consider the energy levels...
