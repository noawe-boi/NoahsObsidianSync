### Research and planning
#### Considered Rationale 

##### Claim: 
'Fossil fuels and biofuels produce carbon dioxide in their combustion'
Evaluate the impact of fossil fuels and biofuels on the environment


###### 


`Choose a biofuel`
Ethanol and gasoline

##### Investigate phenomena associated with claim
- What are biofuels?
Biofuels are fuels created using plants or other forms of biomass. The most well known and utilised by the public are ethanol and methanol. These Biofuels are most commonly added to traditional fuels or are components in standalone alternatives.

- Why are these fuels different (molecules)
While their ability to be sustainably produced is one of the main factors contributing to their widespread adoption, another major factor is the amounts of greenhouse gasses, such as $CO_2$, produced in their combustion. 

Consider the combustion reaction for biofuel, ethanol, in compariison to it's traditonal counterpart, gasoline

| Fuel     | Combustion Formula                                 | $\Delta$H      |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Ethanol  | $C_2H_5OH(l)+3O_2(g)→2CO_2(g)+3H_2O(g)$            | $-1367 kJ/mol$ |
| Gasoline | $2C_8H_{18}(l) + 25O_2(g) → 16CO_2(g) + 18H_2O(g)$ | $-2735 kJ/mol$ |


While they both resemble hydrocarbons, the amount of $CO_2$ produced when optimal combustion occurs varies significantly. Additionally, significantly less oxygen is required for the complete combustion of ethanol, making it less likely for other by-products to form as a result of incomplete combustion.

The differences in molecules also result in differnent ammount of energy, and therefore a different change in enthalpy when burned.

- What happens during combustion (bonds broken etc)
-  $\Delta$Enthalpy (how are energy output different)
 - One real world use

##### Demonstrate development of the research question from the claim
- What effect does more or lack of $CO_2$ have
- How are these fuels used and why?
	- to create energy
	- in cars and other transport
- Can the amount of energy these fuels produce per unit of $CO_2$ produced be quantified
