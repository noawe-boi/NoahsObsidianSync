### Research and planning
#### Considered Rationale 

##### Claim: 
'Fossil fuels and biofuels produce carbon dioxide in their combustion'
Evaluate the impact of fossil fuels and biofuels on the environment


###### 


`Choose a biofuel`
Ethanol and gasoline

##### Investigate phenomena associated with claim
- What are biofuels?
Biofuels are fuels created using plants or other forms of biomass. The most well known and utilised by the public are ethanol and methanol. These Biofuels are most commonly added to traditional fuels or are components in standalone alternatives.

- Why are these fuels different (molecules)
While their ability to be sustainably produced is one of the main factors contributing to their widespread adoption, another major factor is the amounts of greenhouse gasses, such as $CO_2$, produced in their combustion. 




Consider the combustion reaction for biofuel, ethanol, in comparison to it's traditional counterpart, gasoline

| Fuel     | Combustion Formula                                 | $\Delta$H      |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Ethanol  | $C_2H_5OH(l)+3O_2(g)→2CO_2(g)+3H_2O(g)$            | $-1367 kJ/mol$ |
| Gasoline | $2C_8H_{18}(l) + 25O_2(g) → 16CO_2(g) + 18H_2O(g)$ | $-2735 kJ/mol$ |


While they both resemble hydrocarbons, the amount of $CO_2$ produced when optimal combustion occurs varies significantly. Additionally, significantly less oxygen is required for the complete combustion of ethanol, making it less likely for other by-products to form as a result of incomplete combustion.
The differences in molecules also result in different amounts of energy, and therefore a different change in enthalpy when burned.

- What happens during combustion (bonds broken etc)
-  $\Delta$Enthalpy (how are energy output different)
- One real world use 

##### Demonstrate development of the research question from the claim
- What effect does more or lack of $CO_2$ have
- How are these fuels used and why?
	- to create energy
	- in cars and other transport
		- Explain what the E10, E95, etc, numbers mean for later when talking about them and comparing them
- Can the amount of energy these fuels produce per unit of $CO_2$ produced be quantified 



##### Specific and relevant research question 

*Does the addition of biofuel, Ethanol, to unleaded gasoline produce less carbon dioxide per kWh of energy produced in comparison to pure unleaded gasoline?*
##### Relevant Sources




#### Analysis and interpretation
##### *Analysis 1* of qualitative and quantitative data that identifies
###### Relevant evidence
A study conducted by *Argonne National Laboratory Transportation Technology R&D Center* aimed to investigate, quantify, and predict the greenhouse gas emissions produced by passenger vehicles powered by both traditional petroleum, E10, E85 and E95 fuels. The study's overall goal was to predict the impact that newer refining processes would have on the total emissions generated throughout the production process as well as the burning of fuels. These predictions will be ignored, and it will be assumed that the amount of $CO_2$ produced during production is the same across all fuels for the sake of comparison.

**TODO: ADD CITATION FOR GRAPHS**

Figure 1 shows the measured and predicted 
###### Trends, patterns or relationships
In the 'Dry, Current' column, it can be observed that $CO_2$ is the largest components in emissions and is present in all fuel blends. However, the amount of $CO_2$ in each fuel's emissions varies significantly. Regular Unleaded Gasoline releases over 500 grams $CO_2$ per mile while E95 releases less than 400 grams.  


Clearly as the ethanol content of the fuel increases, the amount of $CO_2$ present in emissions decreases. 


###### Limitations
- Assumed that amount of $CO_2$ released in production remains constant. may vary between gasoline and ethanol. Not really a limitation of evidence though... self imposed due to lack of evidence.
