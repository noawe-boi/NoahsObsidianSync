### Research and planning
#### Considered Rationale 

##### Claim: 
'Fossil fuels and biofuels produce carbon dioxide in their combustion'
Evaluate the impact of fossil fuels and biofuels on the environment


###### 


`Choose a biofuel`
Ethanol and gasoline

##### Investigate phenomena associated with claim
- What are biofuels?
Biofuels are fuels created using plants or other forms of biomass. The most well known and utilised by the public are ethanol and methanol. These Biofuels are most commonly added to traditional fuels or are components in standalone alternatives.

- Why are these fuels different (molecules)
While their ability to be sustainably produced is one of the main factors contributing to their widespread adoption, another major factor is the amounts of greenhouse gasses, such as $CO_2$, produced in their combustion. 




Consider the combustion reaction for biofuel, ethanol, in comparison to it's traditional counterpart, gasoline

| Fuel     | Combustion Formula                                 | $\Delta$H      |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Ethanol  | $C_2H_5OH(l)+3O_2(g)→2CO_2(g)+3H_2O(g)$            | $-1367 kJ/mol$ |
| Gasoline | $2C_8H_{18}(l) + 25O_2(g) → 16CO_2(g) + 18H_2O(g)$ | $-2735 kJ/mol$ |


While they both resemble hydrocarbons, the amount of $CO_2$ produced when optimal combustion occurs varies significantly. Additionally, significantly less oxygen is required for the complete combustion of ethanol, making it less likely for other by-products to form as a result of incomplete combustion.
The differences in molecules also result in different amounts of energy, and therefore a different change in enthalpy when burned.

- What happens during combustion (bonds broken etc)
-  $\Delta$Enthalpy (how are energy output different)
- One real world use 

##### Demonstrate development of the research question from the claim
- What effect does more or lack of $CO_2$ have
- How are these fuels used and why?
	- to create energy
	- in cars and other transport
		- Explain what the E10, E95, etc, numbers mean for later when talking about them and comparing them
- Can the amount of energy these fuels produce per unit of $CO_2$ produced be quantified 



##### Specific and relevant research question 

*Does the addition of biofuel, Ethanol, to unleaded gasoline produce less carbon dioxide per kWh of energy produced in comparison to pure unleaded gasoline?*
##### Relevant Sources

###### Relevant evidence
https://publications.anl.gov/anlpubs/1999/02/31961.pdf
A study conducted by *Argonne National Laboratory Transportation Technology R&D Center* aimed to investigate, quantify, and predict the greenhouse gas emissions produced by passenger vehicles powered by both traditional petroleum, E10, E85 and E95 fuels. The study's overall goal was to predict the impact that newer refining processes would have on the total emissions generated throughout the production process as well as the burning of fuels. These predictions will be ignored, and it will be assumed that the amount of $CO_2$ produced during production is the same across all fuels for the sake of comparison.

**TODO: ADD CITATION FOR GRAPHS**

Figure 1 shows the measured and predicted 
###### Trends, patterns or relationships
In the 'Dry, Current' column, it can be observed that $CO_2$ is the largest components in emissions and is present in all fuel blends. However, the amount of $CO_2$ in each fuel's emissions varies significantly. Regular Unleaded Gasoline releases over 500 grams $CO_2$ per mile while E95 releases 20% less, at 400 grams per mile.  

Clearly as the ethanol content of the fuel increases, net  $CO_2$  emissions decrease. 

Additionally, since this data compares a fixed volume of $CO_2$ with an average, fixed, amount of energy, no adjustments have to be made to compensate for the lower energy-per-mole of ethanol in comparison to standard unleaded petrol. 
###### Limitations
- Assumed that amount of $CO_2$ released in production remains constant. may vary between gasoline and ethanol. Not really a limitation of evidence though... self imposed due to lack of evidence. 
- CO^2  is likley less due to the fact that the crops it is made of absorb co2 from the atmosphere

##### *Analysis 2* of qualitative and quantitative data that identifies
###### Relevant evidence

"Comparison of emissions and fuel consumption of a passenger vehicle on two fuels", A report prepared by Prof. Michael Brear, compiles evidence relating to emissions testing conducted on a fixed passenger vehicle running standard, ULP, and biofuel, E10, fuel formulations. Tests were conducted in a standardised 'test cell' and performed over the New European Driving Cycle  (NEDC), a set load series created to benchmark many aspects of vehicles.

<span style="color:grey; font-size:16;font-family:Arial">Figure 2: Cumulative emissions for Holden Captive vehicle over NEDC cycle while running on ULP and E10</span>

###### Trends, patterns or relationships
Figure 2 is a table containing the results from the study's emissions tests. It can be observed that on average, E10, relative to ULP, shows a $5\%$ decrease in grams of $CO_2$ released per 100 km. 
While the reduced fuel economy, or total energy extracted per litre of fuel, does seem intuitive based on the lower energy per mole of ethanol, the study claims that this difference is negligible, so it will be treated as such. 

This evidence further supports the argument that higher ethanol content in fuel decreases $CO_2$ emissions, therefore supporting the research question. 


###### Limitations
Small sample size (literally one car)

###### suggested improvements and extensions *relevant to the claim*
- Exploring aspects further than just combustion. I.e during production and how corn can absorb greenhouse gasses. 
- How could 100% ethanol content fuels compare, do these trends continue?
- $CO_2$ is not the only pollutant created by these fuels. What are these other pollutants and what are their impacts on the enviroment?
