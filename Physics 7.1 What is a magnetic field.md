## Definitions
**Magnetism:** a phenomenon associated with magnetic fields which arise from the motion of electric charges
**Magnetic Field:** a region of space where a magnetic force is experienced
**Magnetic Field Line:** the direction an isolated north pole would move in the field

## Representing a magnetic field
Like gravitational and electric fields, a magnetic field has a vector (direction and magnitude).

## Representing the field direction

Magnetic field diagrams as drawn with field lines and directional arrows indicating the direction
of the force that a small test magnetic north pole would experience if placed in the field 

Flux lines never cross. flux lines are shown as poining away from the north pole or towards the south pole.

## Earths Poles
The 'North Pole' is actually magnetic south and vise versa
