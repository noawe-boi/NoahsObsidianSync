![[Pasted image 20250609092115.png|200]]![[Pasted image 20250424122823.png]]

Alkanes are [[hydrocarbon]]s in which all the bonds are single bonds


#### Formula
To find the make up of any hydrocarbon:
$$C_nH_{2n+2}$$ Where: - $n$ is any number
#### Functional group name 
none
#### Functional group 
none
#### Suffix
**-ane**
e.g. *meth*-**ane**
#### Trivia
- Burns poorly

### Straight chain alkanes
Alkanes where all the carbon atoms are joined in one continuous chain. While these appear perfectly straight in diagrams, they are 3D, and twist as they go on. 
#### Common straight chain alkanes (Condensed formula)
Methane - $CH_4$

Propane - $C_3H_8$ 
Butane - $C_4H_{10}$ 
Octane - $C_8H_{18}$
