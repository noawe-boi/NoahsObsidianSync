## Projectile motion
### Horizontal projection

![[horizontal projection]]


During horizontal projection, the time the object takes to reach the ground is constant *regardless of changes in horizontal velocity*.

### Projection at an angle

![[Projection at angle]]

Once the object reaches the peak, its path is the same as if it was experiencing horizontal projection.
