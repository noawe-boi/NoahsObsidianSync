## Projectile motion
### Horizontal projection

![[horizontal projection]]


During horizontal projection, the time the object takes to reach the ground is constant *regardless of changes in horizontal velocity*. 
![[Drawing 2025-01-29 10.24.41.excalidraw]]

#### To find time taken to fall:
$$t=\sqrt{2*\frac{s}{a}}$$

#### To find distance of fall
$$s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2$$
Where 
- $a=g=-9.8 \; m/s^{-2}$ 
- $t= \textrm{time taken to fall}$

### Projection at an angle

![[Projection at angle]]

Once the object reaches the peak, its path is the same as if it was experiencing horizontal projection.
