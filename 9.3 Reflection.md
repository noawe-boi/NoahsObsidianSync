When a wave reaches the end of a medium:
- Some energy is reflected
- Some energy is absorbed (basically lost)
- Some energy is transmitted (The energy from the sound wave would be transmitted into a new medium)

## Transverse Reflections

The reflected pulse undergoes a 180 degree phase change

The phase change is also referred to as lamda/2
