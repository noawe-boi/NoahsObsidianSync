1. Displacement is a measurement of distance from an origin or point. It does not matter what journey an object takes as long as it ends up in the same place. A particle could go 100m forwards, and then 99m backwards, and its displacement would still be the same as a particle that only went 1m forward.
   Distance is a measure of the length of the total journey that an object takes. Each step of the journey contributes to the total distance and movement in any direction will contribute.

 2. The person could have walked 200m one way, and then 200m back the way they came and end up back at the origin. Since displacement is measured from the origin or starting point, their displacement at the end of their journey would be  0

3. a) distance $=10 \times 25= 250$ 
   b) displacement = distance from origin = 0 
   Since girl ended up back at the start, her distance from her starting point is 0

4. $d=40$, $s=40$ 
   $d=10$, $s=-10$
   $d=20$, $s=20$ 
   $d=50+30 = 80$, $s=50-30=20$

5. 
a) $d=50+30=80km$
b) $s=50-30=20km$

6. 
a) $s=-10m$
b) s=
