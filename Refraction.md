### General Definition 
Refraction is the change in direction of a wave as it travels from one material to another (aka changes medium)

### Refraction of Light
- Refraction is a change in the direction of light
- Caused by change in speed (v) when it passes from one medium to another
- Light rays that enter a new medium perfectly perpendicular to its surface will NOT refract
	- More spread wavefronts mean higher speed. 
#### Refraction of light Diagram + Rules
![[Refraction diagram 2]]
If:
- V1 > V2
then
- Lambda1 > Lambda 2

#### Summary
When a wave transfers to a **slower** medium, the wave refracts 
(*bends*) **towards** the normal.
When a Wave transfers to a **faster** medium, the wave refracts (*bends*) **away** from the normal
