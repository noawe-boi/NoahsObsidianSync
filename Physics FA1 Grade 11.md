## Physics IA2 Report Structure


### `Hey Mr Ace,`
`please excuse the trash formatting in this, The prompts/titles will be absent or more relevant in my final submission. Did some AI magic and got it to generate them from the task sheet and sample responses, as well as the work I had already done and existing notes i had taken on my word document to make sure it still matched up. (I'll explain it in class. im not cheating I promise).`

`anyways, also missing at the moment are some graphs/figures, referencing and the entire report from methodology and onwards`

`good luck 💀`


## 1. Research Question:

- Clearly state your research question:

Can the speed of a sound wave be accurately calculated by investigating the relationship between the frequency of the 7th harmonic of a pipe and then varying length of a pipe with open ends

## 2. Rationale:

- **Original Experiment:**
- Explain the purpose and methodology of the original experiment

 The purpose of the original experiment was to calculate the speed of a sound wave in air by finding and measuring the frequency of the harmonics in a fixed length of pipe with open ends

- Mention the independent and dependent variables.

The harmonic of the pipe was the independent variable and the factor that was altered in between trials that all other changes were caused by
- Describe how the relationship between frequency and harmonic number was established (using the formula and fine-tuning by ear).
The frequency of each harmonic was the dependent variable and first estimated using the equation $f=(273\pm5.75)n$ 

This initial value was then fine tuned to become or confirmed to be the harmonic through listening to the pipe with one ear and determining at what frequencies it sounded loudest. By plotting the desired harmonic of the pipe that the frequency being played corresponds with on the x axis and the current frequency being played on the y axis, the gradient of the graph corresponds with the relationship between each harmonic and the frequency of it.
 
 - *Present the derived equation for sound wave speed.*

By substituting in the equation $f=\frac{v}{\lambda}$  , substituting in the equation ,and re-arranging the formula to become $\lambda = \frac{4L}{n}$ 

Where $v$ is the speed of the sound wave (m/s) and $L$ is the length of the pipe (m), the speed of sound could be found.

- Discuss the limitations of the original experiment (reliance on human hearing).

While this experiment was successful in calculating the speed of sound to $\pm$ $2.1$% uncertainty and $4.21$% error compared to the accepted value of 343m/s, it relied heavily on a persons ability to find the harmonic frequency by ear, which differed from person to person. This also limited the number of harmonic that were able to be tested as high frequency sounds were either too difficult to perceive, or impossible to perceive by humans. Additionally, changing the frequency being played through the speaker is an inaccurate way to find the harmonic as resonances in the speaker itself could alter the intensity or loudness of the sound waves it creates.

- **Justification for Modification:** 

- Explain why the original experiment needs modification (to eliminate reliance on human hearing and improve accuracy).

Relying on human perception of sound created too many variables for it to be viable when any sort of precision is needed. Changing the frequency of the sound wave significantly was also a poor way to find the pipes harmonic. Therefore the experiment was modified.

- *State the modification: changing the pipe length instead of frequency.*
A dB meter was used to determine when the pipe was tuned to a harmonic as it could objectively and quantitively measure sound intensity. Additionally, Instead of changing the harmonic of the sound wave to change harmonic, the length of the pipe was altered, which reduced the range of frequencies that had to be played
- *Describe the expected relationship between pipe length and the 7th harmonic frequency 
 
The expected relationship between the pipe length and the 7th harmonic frequency
