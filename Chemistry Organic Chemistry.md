### Organic molecules
#### What are organic molecules
Organic molecules have hydrocarbon skeletons. 
### Hydrocarbons
#### What are hydrocarbons?
As the same suggests:
**Hydrocarbons** are made up of *hydrogen* and *carbon* atoms. 

Hydrocarbons are named based on the number of carbon atoms present in the ain chat, and the bonding that exists between carbon atoms. 
#### Carbon
##### Carbon's electron configuration
Carbon has an electron configuration of 2, 4
	2 inner electrons
	4 valence electrons
##### Carbon Based life
*All life on earth is made up of carbon*
Carbon has the **maximum** number of bonds out of any element
	Therefore a variety of combinations and structures can occur



Carbon forms covalent bonds with four hydrogen atoms to form *methane* ($CH_4$), the most simple hydrocarbon
