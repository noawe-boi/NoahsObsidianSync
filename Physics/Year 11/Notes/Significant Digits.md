## Adding and subtracting
- All non 0 numbers are significant
- Zeros between to significant digits are significant. 
- Zeros at the end of a number 'and' often a decimal point are significant. 
- Everything else is insignificant

### Examples

- 1kg = 0.5kg --> 1.49kg = 1000g


- 101M is more precise that 100M


- 460,000 has 2 significant digits. 
The remaining 0's do not 


- 460,000.0 has 7 significant digits
The decimal points tells us that it has precision to 1 DP
"why would we be told it is -.0 if it wasn't accurate"


- 0.006 has 1 significant digit
The 6 is the only significant digit. they do not communicate precision but only show the unit. 
6mm = 0.006M



## Multiplying and Dividing
- When multiplying and dividing, the solution cannot have more significant digits than any of the contributors or components

### Examples
- 640.0 * 5.4 = 3456 = 3500
5.4 only has 2 significant digits, Meaning the answer can only have 2. 

- 22.1 / 0.0070 = 3157.142857 = 3200
While 22.1 has 3 significant figures, 0.0070 only has 2, meaning the answer can only have 2
