## If an object is above the ground it is storing gravitational potential energy or ( [[Gravitational Potential Energy]] ) . 

Higher Altitude = Higher [[Gravitational Potential Energy]]. 

## Calculating [[Gravitational Potential Energy]] 
Can be calculated interchangeably with [[Kinetic Energy]] 
#### [[Gravitational Potential Energy]] = m x a x h
#### where
- [[Gravitational Potential Energy]] = Gravitational potential energy in [[Joules]]
- m = [[Mass]] in kg
- a = [[Acceleration]] in m/s/s
	- h = [[Height]] in m


#### Examples
###### if a brick is 10m high and weighs 20kg, how much energy will it have to fall onto some ones head
- [[Mass]] = 20kg
- [[Height]] = 10m
- [[Acceleration]] = 9.8m/s/s (earths gravitational pull)
- therefore [[Gravitational Potential Energy]] = 20kg x 10m x 9.8m/s/s = 1960 Joules

##### if a 0.5kg ball is dropped from a height of 4 meters
- [[Mass]] = 0.5kg
- [[Height]]= 10m
- [[Acceleration]] = 9.8m/s
- therefore [[Gravitational Potential Energy]] = 0.5kg x 9.8m/s x 10m = 49 Joules
