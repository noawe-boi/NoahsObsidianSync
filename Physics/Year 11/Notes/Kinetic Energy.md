## The energy an object in motion has. 
 Think flywheel, no thats interia?

## Calculating [[Kinetic Energy]]

#### Can be calculated interchangibly with [[Gravitational Potential Energy]]

#### [[Kinetic Energy]] = 0.5 x m x s^2
#### where
- M = [[Mass]] in kg
- S = [[Speed]] in m/s

#### Use the gravitational potential energy formula to calculate the energy of an object that has fallen a certain distance


### Example

###### - a 2kg water bottle is dropped from a bridge 10m high.
- it reaches a speed of 
- what is its max kinetic energy?
- [[Speed]] = [[Mass]] x [[Acceleration]]
- [[Gravitational Potential Energy]] = 2kg x 9.8 m/s * 10m = 196J

- Technically [[Gravitational Potential Energy]] and [[Kinetic Energy]] are the same in this scenario
- assuming no air resistance


###### If a ford focus is travelling at 5m/s and weighs 1300 kg 
- [[Mass]] = 1300kg
- [[Velocity]] or [[Speed]] = 5m/s
-[[Kinetic Energy]]= 0.5 x (5m/s)^2 x 1300kg = 3250 [[Joules]]

##### if a 0.5kg ball has fallen 5m
- [[Mass]] = 0.5kg
- [[Velocity]] or [[Speed]] = 9.8m/s x 5
- [[Kinetic Energy]] = 0.5kg x 9.8m/s x 5m  = 24.5J
