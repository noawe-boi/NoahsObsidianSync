 ### Energy cannot be created or destroyed
 - energy can only be transferred or transformed into other types of energy
 - the total energy in the system stays the same 
 - most forms of energy end up becoming heat


### Example
#####  A mixer is turned on and the electricity is converted into kinetic energy, sound and heat. 
- the electricity is converted into [[Kinetic Energy]], Sound and heat
- the kinetic energy and sound all become heat 


##### A girl is jumping on a trampoline 
- [[Work]] is done in when she puts [[Force]] into the trampoline
- as she lands on the trampoline, it does work on her and gives her upwards velocity in the form of [[Kinetic Energy]]
- as she travels upwards, her [[Kinetic Energy]] is converted into [[Gravitational Potential Energy]]
