Consider the formula $$t=\frac{t_0}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}=t_0\cdot\gamma$$

Where:
- $t$ is the time that the observer sees (dilated time)
- $t_0$ is the measured time
- $c$ is the speed of light
- $v$ is the velocity that the observer is travelling.
- $\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$
