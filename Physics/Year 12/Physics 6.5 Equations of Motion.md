**These apply when acceleration is constant**

## Formulas
### Average Acceleration
If acceleration is constant then:
$$V_{Average} = \frac{v+u}{2}$$ and
$$ \frac{s}{t} = \frac{v+u}{2}$$
$\therefore$ 
$$ s = \frac{v+u}{2}\times t$$

### Velocity Time Graphs

#### Gradient
$$ gradient = \frac{\Delta V}{t} = a$$
#### Area Below Graph
$$s=ut+\frac{1}{2}\times t \times (v-u)$$ However, we know that $(v-u) = at$ , $\therefore$ 
$$s=u t+\frac{1}{2}  a  t^2$$
###### Note
Since this function is a quadratic, there may be instances where a single "y value" has multiple points in time where it is valid


#### Other
Substitute $t=\frac{v-u}{a}$ into $s=u t+\frac{1}{2}  a  t^2$

$$v^2 = u^2 + 2as$$  

#### Acceleration due to gravity 
$g = -9.8ms^{-1}$ 


## Example 6.5.1 p226
![[Pasted image 20241028124503.png]]
$u = 10.0ms^{-1}$
$s = 20.0m$
$a=?$ 
*However is it uniform*
$v = 0ms^{-1}$ 

$v^2 = u^2 + 2 as \rightarrow a = \frac{v^2-u^2}{2s} = a = \frac{-10^2}{2(20)} ={-2.5ms^{-2}}$
