## Motion of objects launched at angles
The motion of an object at a parabola is a function of time
$$s_y=u_yt+\frac{1}{2}at^2$$ $$s=vt-\frac{1}{2}at^2$$ Where:
- $s=\textrm{displacement}$
- $v=\textrm{final velocity}$
- $a=\textrm{acceleration}$
- $t =\textrm{time}$

### Landing at the same height as at launch
If this occurs,
- $\textrm{impact speed} = \textrm{launch speed}$
- $\textrm{impact velocity} = -\textrm{launch velocity}$
-  $\textrm{vertical displacement}$ = 0


#### Worked Example
##### WORKED EXAMPLE 1.3A

### Landing at a lower height than at launch
If this occurs:
- Vertical displacement at impact is no longer zero. Is some negative quantity

### Landing at higher point than launch height
If this occurs:
- Vertical displacement at impact is no longer zero. Is some positive quantity.

## Finding t and s in various conditions

### Vertical 
$s=0, u_y=u\sin \theta, a=-9.8m/s^{2}$ 

Consider
	$s=ut+ \frac{1}{2}at^2$

Substitute known values for $s$ and $u$ and factor out $t$
	$0=t(u \sin \theta + \frac{1}{2} at)$ 

divide by t (assuming $t\neq 0$ ) and substitute known value for $a$
	 $t=\frac{-2u\sin \theta}{-9.8}$
	 $\therefore t=\frac{u}{4.9}\sin \theta$
### Horizontal
$v_x = u\cos \theta, t=\frac{u}{4.9}\sin \theta$ 

Consider
	$v_x = \frac{s}{t}$

Substitute known value for $v_x$ and multiply by $t$. Substitute known value for $t$
	$s=u \cos \theta \times (\frac{u \sin}{4.9})$
	$\therefore s=\frac{u^2 \cos \theta }{4.9} \sin \theta$ 

This is in the form of $y=mx+c$ (where $c=0$)
	$s=\frac{u^2 \cos \theta }{4.9} \sin \theta$
	$= \frac{u \cos \theta }{4.9}u \sin \theta$ 
	$u_x \sin \theta$ (horizontal velocity) is constant. Clearly top of fraction is just $u_x \sin \theta \times u$
