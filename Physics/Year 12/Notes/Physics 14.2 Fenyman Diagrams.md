### Space-time graph 
#### What are they??
In space time graphs, we consider space to be a single dimension. 
	Can be thought of as representing the 'trajectory' or distance of particles relative to an origin. 
#### Horizontal lines
The particle moves through space over time. 
#### Vertical lines
The particle moves through space instantaneously.
#### Slope
Slope represents the change in speed. 
	Steeper $\implies$Faster
	(more change in displacement over the same period of time)

#### Representing particle motion
##### Particle motion
- We draw regular particle motion as a line or function travelling with time
![[Physics 14.2 Fenyman Diagrams 2025-07-29 13.48.40.excalidraw]]
e.g. electron travelling at constant speed

##### Antiparticle motion
- We draw **anti**-particle motion as a line or function travelling backwards or opposite to time
	This might not actually be the case but it makes it more clear that these are anti-particles
![[Physics 14.2 Fenyman Diagrams 2025-07-29 13.52.40.excalidraw]]
e.g. positron travelling at constant speed

##### Gauge boson motion
- We represent gauge bosons with squiggly lines
![[Physics 14.2 Fenyman Diagrams 2025-07-29 13.55.40.excalidraw]]
e.g. $W^+$ boson

#### Particle interactions
##### Vertex
The point at which particle interact. 
At this point they will emit or absorb new particles; deflecting one another or changing type

##### Vertex location and direction
For external particles (real particles), if the particle is incoming, the vertex is on the right, and if it is outgoing the vertex is on the left. It is not always shown with a dot. The lines are drawn horizontally here to save space.
