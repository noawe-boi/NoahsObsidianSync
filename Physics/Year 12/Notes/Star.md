## Types of Stars

### Main sequence stars
- Forms a band comprising 90 percent of stellar types
- during most of its lifetime they are representative of the stages a normal star passes through


### Red giants
- When all HI is used up, He Turns to C. 
- The star swells to many times its original size an the surface becomes cooler


### White dwarf
- Small hot stars
- the core matter at the centre of a planetary nebula
- only the fraction of the size of an original star. about the same size as the earth but much denser

### Black dwarf
- Occurs after a white dwarf star stops producing light and heat
- can no longer be seen


### Neutron Star
- after a supernova occurs, a neutron star is formed. 
- gravity pulls on the star itself so the atoms are packed so tightly together that the electrons collide with the protons to create neutrons, creating an extremely dense mass of neutrons
