## The properties of friction
- Friction is a force between two surfaces moving relative to one another. 
- It opposes motion
- Measured in Newtons
### Worked Example
#### 2.2A

## Tension
### What is tension?
The pulling force transmitted through ropes or chains. 
Uses symbol $F_T$ 
If acceleration is 0, then net force is 0
#### Tension at rest
An object hangs from a rope. There is tension from the rope pulling on the block (supporting its weight), and from the rope pulling on the scaffolding it is resting on. The normal forces hold, and the system is at rest

#### Tension during acceleration
Consider 
$F_{net} = F_T - F_g$

Imagine the rope is being pulled upwards by a crane, in this case, the net force would be upwards. To compensate for this, $F_T$ would increase.

### Force applied at an angle
##### NOTE: Always make $\theta$ relative to the horizontal
#### Worked example 2.3A

### Pulled up frictionless plane with cables
$F_{net} = F_T - F_P$  
Where:
- $F_{net}$ = The net force acting on the object
- $F_P =$ The force down the incline
- $F_T =$ The tension in the cable
