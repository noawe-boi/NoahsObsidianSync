## Vectors
### What is a vector?
A vector is a measure of direction and magnitude. Vectors are represented as arrows with length equal to magnitude, and direction equal to direction

### Vector addition
Vector addition is performed by arranging vectors head to tails


### Resolving a vector into its components

#### To find the horizontal component
$$V_x = u \cos{(\theta)}$$
#### To find the vertical component
$$V_t = u \sin{(\theta)}$$

#### This is because...
$$\frac{O}{H} = \sin{\theta}$$
$$O\sin{\theta} = H$$

## Projectile motion

### Velocity at specific moments
- Vertical velocity is mirrored along the peak of the arc
