### What is an impulse
Pretty much the difference in momentum over a given time frame. Time is not included in calculations though

#### Regular Impulse

##### Formula

$$I=\Delta \rho = mv=mu$$
Where:
- $I$ is the impulse
- $\Delta \rho$ is the change in momentum
- $m$ is mass
- $u$ is the initial velocity (or velocity in the first time frame)
- $v$ is the final velocity (or velocity in the last time frame)

##### Formula
IMPULSE IS AREA UNDER THE GRAPH
$$I=F_{av}\cdot \Delta t$$
Where:
- $I$ is the impulse
- $F_{av}$ is the average force
- $\Delta t$ is the change in time
