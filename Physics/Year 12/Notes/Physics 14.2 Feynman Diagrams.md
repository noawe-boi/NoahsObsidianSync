### Space-time graph 
#### What are they??
In space time graphs, we consider space to be a single dimension. 
	Can be thought of as representing the 'trajectory' or distance of particles relative to an origin. 
#### Horizontal lines
The particle moves through space over time. 
#### Vertical lines
The particle moves through space instantaneously.
#### Slope
Slope represents the change in speed. 
	Steeper $\implies$Faster
	(more change in displacement over the same period of time)

#### Representing particle motion
##### Particle motion
- We draw regular particle motion as a line or function travelling with time
![[Physics 14.2 Fenyman Diagrams 2025-07-29 13.48.40.excalidraw]]
e.g. electron travelling at constant speed

##### Antiparticle motion
- We draw **anti**-particle motion as a line or function travelling backwards or opposite to time
	This might not actually be the case but it makes it more clear that these are anti-particles

e.g. positron travelling at constant speed

##### Gauge boson motion
- We represent gauge bosons with squiggly lines

e.g. $W^+$ boson
