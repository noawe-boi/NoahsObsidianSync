#physics 
All matter is made up of tiny particles that all have charge. This charge can be positive, negative or neutral. 

Usually, the number of positive and negative charges balance out perfectly. 

when enough charged particles become separated or move relative to each other, it results in electricity 

### Elementary Charge and Coulomb

The elementary charge, +e, of a proton is equal to 1.6x10^-19 C (Coulomb's)

q = n(electrons) x (-e)

Where:
- Qu is the amount of charge in Coulomb 
- n(electrons) is the number of electrons
- -e is the charge of one electrons (1.6x10^-19 Coulomb's)
