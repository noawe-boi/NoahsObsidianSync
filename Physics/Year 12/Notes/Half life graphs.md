#### Observations
The percentage of $Es-242$ remaining drops by a factor of 2 each half-life. After one half-life there is only 50% of the nuclei remaining, and after two half-lives there is now only 25% of the nuclei remaining and so on.
#### The shape of the graph 
The shape of the curve is identical for *every single element*. The only difference between them is the scale of the $t$ axis.
