### The squared relationship
#### Example 
Item 3 (2 Marks) Identify the relationship between the horizontal distance travelled, s, and the initial velocity, u, of the projectile. Use evidence from Table 1 to support your answer.

When initial velocity doubles from 2.0m/s to 4m/s, the average distance is scaled by a factor of 0.3531.414​≈4. However, when velocity triples from 2.0m/s to 6.0m/s, average distance is scaled by a factor of 0.3533.181​≈9. It is seen that average distance is scaled by the square of the factor that initial velocity is multiplied by.
