## The laws
### The first law of planetary motion

Orbits aren't actually perfect circles.

Kepler's law of orbit states that:
	**All** planets move about the sun in **elliptical** orbits.

### The second law of planetary motion
The speed of objects in orbits is not constant.

Kepler's second law or orbit states that:
	If the time taken or a planet to travel from $R$ to $S$ is the same as that to travel from $L$ to $M$, then area $A$ will equal area B

### The third law of planetary motion
The square of the period of The motion over the radius of the motion cubed is constant (Also known as Kepler's ratio).

Kepler's third law of motion states that:
	$\frac{T^2}{r^3} =\text{A constant on the formula sheet}$

This also means that:
	If you increase the distance from the orbiting body, you increase the time it takes for a revolution to occur

## Combining Kepler's and Newton's laws
### Newtons Third law and Keplers third law
Consider 
$$F_{g}=F_{}{c}$$
$$\frac{GMm}{r^2}=\frac{mv^2}{r}$$
$$\frac{GMmr}{r^2m}=\frac{GM}{r}=v^2$$
$$\therefore GM=v^2r=\left( \frac{2\pi r}{2} \right)^2r$$
$$\therefore\text{Keplers third law,}\; \frac{T^2}{r^2}= \frac{4\pi ^2}{GM},\; \text{is a constant} $$
