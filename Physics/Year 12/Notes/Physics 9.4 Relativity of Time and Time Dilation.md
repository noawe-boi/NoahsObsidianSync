### Time Dilation formula
![[Time Dilation Formula]]
### Einstein's thought experiment
Basically boils down to: 
If I was travelling close to the speed of light, then the light would have to catch up to me before I could see it. 

Think of a car travelling next to you on the highway that is travelling slightly faster; It will approach you but much much slower than if you were stationary. It will barley creep closer. 

The light will do the same, and since you are seeing the light at a slower rate, the area you see will appear slower
