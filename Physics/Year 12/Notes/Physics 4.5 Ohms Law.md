Ohms Law States
V=IR
Where:
- V is the potential difference in Volts (V)
- I is the current in amps (A)
- R is the constant of proportionality (restiance) in Ohms


To find the resistance of an Ohmic (linear) conductor, 
- Find the gradient from the graph, 
- Sub into (1/R) = m
- Solve

e.g.
m = 3/6

R/1 = 3/6
R = 6/3 = 2 Ohms
