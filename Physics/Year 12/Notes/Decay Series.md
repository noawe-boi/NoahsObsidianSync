### What are decay series
When radioactive decay occurs, the daughter nuclei are often not stable. 
This will cause them to decay again. 

A decay series shows the process of decay until a stable configuration is reached

### What kinds of questions will beta decay 
- May have to determine what type of decay occurs
- May have to determine what element is in a specific position based on surrounding elements and/or type of decay that occurred.
