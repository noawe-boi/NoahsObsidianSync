- Energy used is referred to as the input and is converted into other forms of energy
- the useful energy resulting from this transformation is the output. 
- Energy is usually 'lost'  as heat. 

##### The efficiency of an energy transfer is a measure of how much useful energy is produced and can be expressed as:
 E = (useful energy output/total energy output) x 100
 where:
 - E = [[Energy Efficiency]]

## Formula

#### Efficiency as a percentage
Efficiency = (Useful Energy / Total Energy) x 100 %
or 
r = (output / input) x 100 %

### Old Examples

##### A basketball is bouncing and each bounce it loses energy 
total energy = [[Gravitational Potential Energy]] = m x a x h1
where:
- m = [[Mass]] in Kg
- a = [[Acceleration]] in m/s
- h1 = [[Height]] the basketball was dropped from in meters

useful energy = [[Gravitational Potential Energy]] = m x a x h2
where:
- m = [[Mass]] in Kg
- a = [[Acceleration]] in m/s
- h2 = [[Height]] the basketball **RETURNED TO after the initial bounce** in meters

therefore 
E = (useful energy/total energy) x 100


### Textbook examples
#### Example 2.7.2
a particular Bunsen burner provides 76000J of heat to a beaker of water. The useful energy tha theated the water is only 27000 Joules and the rest is lost the the environment. 

r = (27000/76000) x 100 = 35.52% = 36%
