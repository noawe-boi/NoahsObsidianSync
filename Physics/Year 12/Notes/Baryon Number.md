### Definition
Quantum number of a system that is strictly conserved and additive (you can only add or subtract from it. Pretty much $\textrm{number of quarks} - \textrm{number of anti-quarks}$
$$B=\frac{1}{3}(n_q-n_\hat q)$$
	Where
	- $n_q$ is is the number of [[Quark]]s
	- $n_\hat q$ is the number of anti-[[Quark]]s

### Knowledge requirements
Only expected to figure out whether the [[Baryon Number]] is conserved

![[{91A4645F-3B3C-4C1B-83F8-F5F4F43E7B97}.png]]
LHS: 2 Neutrons + 2 Protons + 5 [[Neutron]]s + 4 [[Proton]]s: 7 Neutrons total
RHS: 6 Neutrons + 6 Protons + 1 Neutron: 7 Neutrons total
$\therefore$ LHS=RHS and baryon number is conserved



### Examples
