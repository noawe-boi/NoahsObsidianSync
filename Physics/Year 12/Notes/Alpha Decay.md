### When does this occur
When the atom is unable to create a stable configuration and therefore must eject particles.

### What is ejected
An [[Alpha Particle]]
![[Alpha Particle]]
### Danger level
Low (unless you're really close)
#### Why?
- Can steal electrons - [[Ionising Radiation]]
- Can't actually go very far
#### Penetrating potential
Very low
### Effect of this 
- Parent loses:
	- Two protons
	- Two neutrons
### Energy Released
Mass difference in alpha decay
= mass of parent nucleus – mass of daughter nucleus – mass of $^4_2He$

$\textrm{Energy}=m_{\textrm{parent isotope}} - m_{\textrm{daughter isotope}} - 4.002604)\cdot 931.6. \textrm{MeV}$
