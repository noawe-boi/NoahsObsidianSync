### What is nuclear fusion?
The opposite of [[Nuclear Fission]], i.e.
- Taking two light nuclei (usually hydrogen or helium) and fusing them together into a larger - more stable - nuclei

- Useful for creating energy (see [[Mass defect and binding energy]])

### Examples
#### Example 3.6.2
A deuterium (hydrogen-2) nucleus fuses with a tritium (hydrogen-3) nucleus to produce an alpha particle and a neutron.

Consider the fusion reaction, remember to add neutron to balance. Add energy released - check [[Mass defect and binding energy]] for more details about the graph
$^2_1H+^3_1H\rightarrow^4_2He+^1_0n$

**Remember:** The energy on the right hand side is more than what was on the left because this fusion reaction is endothermic

We require the $\Delta m$
We have the mass of the entire atom - we *should* have been removing the mass of an electron before, however this electron is likely a significant portion of the mass of the atom anyways. They also called the alpha particle an alpha particle, alpha particles dont have electrons

$\Delta m = 2.01410178+3.0160492-(2\cdot\frac{9.1093835\cdot10^{-31}}{1.66\cdot10^{-27}})-(4.001506+1.008665)\approx 0.018882463915662u$
Now convert to kg
$0.018882463915662\times1.66\times10^{-27}\approx 3.134489009999892\cdot10^{-29}$
==NOW WE DO $E=mc^2$==!!!!!

$E=3.134489009999892\cdot10^{-29}\cdot(3\cdot10^8)^2= 28210401089999028\cdot10^{-28}J=2.8210401089999028\cdot10^{-12}J$
$E=2.8210401089999028\cdot10^{-12}\cdot\frac{1}{1.60\cdot10^{-19}}\approx 17,631,500.681,249,392,5$
