### Definition(s).
Magnetic Flux: A measurement of the total field that passes through a given area. Measured in 'weber' 
Magnetic Flux Density: the strength of a magnetic field of number of field lines per unit area (B)



### Flux through a loop perpendicular to the field. 
Magnetic field strength = flux density, i.e.
$1T = 1Wb$/$m^2$
If one arrow was used to represent a single line of flux with a strength of 1Wb, then 4 arrows flowing through an area of 1$m^2$ would have a flux density of 4$Wb/m^2$

### Flux at an angle field.
When the plane of the loop is not at a $90\degree$ angle to the field, fewer flux lines will thread the same sized loop.
A formula is needed to take this angle into account. $\phi = \beta A \cos (\theta)$
Where:
- $\beta$ is the magnetic field strength
- $A$ is the area of the loop
- $\theta$ is the angle that the plane of the loop makes with the field


#### Worked Example 8.1B.

### Flux Inside a solenoid.
A solenoid carrying current will have a magnetic field inside it running from one end to the other. To find the amount of flux, first know the field strength and cross-sectional area ($\beta$ and A respectively). 
The formula for magnitude of field strength in the solenoids center is 
$\beta = \micro _0 n I$
Where:
- $\beta is the magnetic field strength
- $\micro _0$ is the permeability constant $1.26 * 10^-6$ T m $A^-1$*
- n is the number of turns per meter
- I is the Current in Amps
