### Circuits in parallel

Components are in parallel when there are multiple paths for current to flow. 

![[Parallel Circuits example]]

Resistors in parallel 'lower' the overall resistance of the circuit


### Calculating total resistance in parallel circuits
![[Parallel resistance formuler]]
Note this only applies to diagram but still works as a formula. 


### Example 1
![[Parallel Circuits Really Long Example]]


### Example 2
