### Why?
As you approach the speed of light, the way we measure momentum with $\rho = mv$ diverges from reality.
### How to find it 
Consider the formula:
$$
\rho_v=\frac{m_0 v}{\sqrt{c-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
$$
Where:
$m_0$ is the rest mass of the object
$v$ is the velocity of the object (usually in terms of $c$)
$c$ is the speed of light
#### Simplified
This is pretty much just 
$\rho = mv \cdot \gamma$ 
Where:
$\gamma$ is the lorenz or relativistic factor ($\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$)
