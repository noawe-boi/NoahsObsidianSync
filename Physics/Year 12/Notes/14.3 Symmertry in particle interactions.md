## Types of symmetry
### Charge reversal symmetry
Often when an interaction occurs, by 'flpping' particles into their 'anti' or reversed equivalents and vise versa, the result will be the same but flipped as well. 
#### Example
Original:
$\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu ^+ + v_\mu$
Flipped:
$\pi^- \rightarrow \mu^- + \bar v _\mu$

*The charges have been swapped, but the interaction is otherwise identical.* 

### Time Reversal symmetry 
If you consider a glass falling to the ground and breaking, if you throw all the pieces back up on to where it fell, it doesn't just reform back into a glass. For some interactions, this is the case, however for others, reversing the time axis simply reverses the interaction. 
#### Example

*The time axis is reversed, but interaction is otherwise identical. Arrows keep facing the same way as no particles are made 'anti'*

### Crossing symmetry (X)
When you move something from one side of the equation to another, you must make it its 'anti' versoin
#### Examples
If a particle interaction is known, you can expect the following interactions. 

Consider known interaction: $A+B\rightarrow C + D$ 
- $A+B+\bar C \rightarrow D$ 
- $A+\bar C \rightarrow \bar B + D$
- $B \rightarrow \bar A + C + D$

## Probability of reactions
![[{1C3CA5B7-04A1-4089-8C21-177CD3D2816D}.png]]
Considering the reaction above (neutron decay), this is a much more common outcome than the reversal. The probability of all particles in section *(b)* being at the same place, at the same time is very low. 
Neutron decay is much more common, and occurs during events like the decay of $^{14}C$ 

## Exceptions
There are more rules than discussed, and many exceptions to them. 

## Summary
1. Three important symmetries are [[14.3 Symmertry in particle interactions#Charge reversal symmetry]], [[14.3 Symmertry in particle interactions#Time Reversal symmetry]], [[14.3 Symmertry in particle interactions#Crossing symmetry (X)]] 
2. Symmetry are generally upheld
3. Conservation of energy and momentum is always conserved
4. When symmetry is violated, that form of symmetry cannot be a universal law of nature.
