### Types of symmetry
#### Charge reversal symmetry
Often when an interaction occurs, by 'flpping' particles into their 'anti' or reversed equivalents and vise versa, the result will be the same but flipped as well. 
##### Example
Original:
$\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu ^+ + v_\mu$
Flipped:
$\pi^- \rightarrow \mu^- + \bar v _\mu$

*The charges have been swapped, but the interaction is otherwise identical.* 

#### Time Reversal symmetry 
If you consider a glass falling to the ground and breaking, if you throw all the peices back up on to where it fell, it doesn't just reform back into a glass. For some interactions, this is the case, however for others, reversing the time axis simply reverses the ineraction.

*The time axis is reversed, but interaction is otherwise identical. Arrows keep facing the same way as no particles are made 'anti'*
