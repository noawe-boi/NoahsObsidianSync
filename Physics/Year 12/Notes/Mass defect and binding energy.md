### What is mass defect
During the course of a nuclear reaction, mass is converted to energy (or 'lost'). The difference between the theoretical mass, and the actual mass (due to lost mass) is called the mass defect.
$\Delta m = \textrm{mass of atom} - (\textrm{theoretical mass of ptotons}+ \textrm{theoretical mass of neutrons})$
==The overall difference in an atoms mass, and the mass of its components.==
### Binding energy
The energy equivalent of the mass defect is the **binding energy**. The binding energy is energy that keeps the nucleus together. Due to [[Physics 3.5 Mass energy equivalence]], this manifests as extra mass. 
#### Finding the binding energy Energy($u$)$=931.6$  $$\Delta E = 931.6 \cdot \Delta m$$

						Fusion $\rightarrow$              $\leftarrow$ Fission
Going left: Consider from Uranium 238 to Iron (Fe), You are releasing energy

Going Right: Consider from Hydrogen 2 to Helium 3, if you do fission you are going to lose energy, however if you do fusion you are going to gain a bunch of energy.

===We can strategically go left or right depending on whether we want to release, or absorb energy.===
