### What are leptons
Similar to quarks, but do not form composites (like [[Baryon]]s).
#### Characteristics of leptons
- Do not form composites with eachother.
- Interact with the [[Weak Nuclear Force]], (not the [[Strong Nuclear Force]])
- Charged (interact via [[Electromagnetic Force]])
- Stable 
	Except for [[Muon]] and [[Tau]] as they have too much energy. They break down into [[Electron]]s and [[Electron Neutrino]]s

### Family of leptons
- [[Muon]]
- [[Tau]]
- [[Electron]]
- [[Muon Neutrino]]
- [[Tau Neutrino]]
- [[Electron Neutrino]]
