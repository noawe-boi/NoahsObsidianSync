### What is it?
Half life the time it takes for a mass of radioactive substance to decay so that it is half its original weight.


#### Solving for nuclei
#### When is there none left?
There is usually not a detectable amount after 6 half life's. Not always the case though depending on starting amount
Theoretically there will never be none left due to asymptote at $y=0$

### Solving for half life
#### Solving for mass
$$N(t) = N_0 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{t}{t_{\frac{1}{2}}}}$$
Where
- $t$ is time
- $t_{\frac{1}{2}}$ is half life
- $N_0$ is the starting mass
- $N$ is the mass
#### Solving for particles
$$N=N_0\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n$$
Where
- $N$ is the mass or number of nuclei remaining
- $N_0$ is the initial mass or initial number of nuclei 
- $n$ is the number of half life's elapsed


#### Solving for number of half lives elapsed
$$n=\frac{t}{t_\frac{1}{2}}$$
Where:
- $t$ is time
- $t_{\frac{1}{2}}$ is half life
- $n$ is the number of half life's elapsed
