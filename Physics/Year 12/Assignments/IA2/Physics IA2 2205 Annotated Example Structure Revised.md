#### **Rationale**
*   **Why** are you doing this experiment? What's the purpose and reasons?
*   Briefly mention the **original experiment** and what it did.
*   **Explain the physics ideas/background scientific information** behind your experiment.
*   **Why did you change** the original experiment (refine, extend, or redirect)?
*   How does this modification help you test your question?
*   Link back to your **Research Question**.

#### **Method**
*   Briefly describe the **original method**.
*   List **exactly what you changed** (the Modifications). Justify these changes.
*   Explain **how you handled risks** in the experiment (Management of Risk).
*   Make sure your method allowed you to collect **sufficient and relevant data**.

#### **Results**
*   Show your **Raw Data** clearly (like in a table). Collect **sufficient and relevant** data.
*   Show **Calculations** you did to process the data (like averages, uncertainty). Use **appropriate algorithms, visual and graphical representations**. Show **how you calculated uncertainty** (absolute or percentage? Use absolute for graph errors).
*   Show your **Graphs**. Make sure they follow **scientific conventions** (labels, units, error bars).

#### **Analysis of Evidence**
*   **Look at your processed data and graphs**.
*   **What patterns, trends, or relationships** do you see? Describe them clearly.
*   Talk about the **uncertainty** in your data and **what limits** your evidence.

#### **Interpretation and Conclusion**
*   **What is the answer to your Research Question** based on your data? This should be a **justified conclusion linked to the research question**.
*   Explain **what your results mean**, considering the patterns and uncertainty you found.
*   Compare your results to the **physics theory** you mentioned in the Rationale.
*   Briefly state if your conclusion is **reliable** and **valid** (you'll explain more below).

#### **Evaluation of Experimental Process & Suggestions**
*   **How good was your experiment?** Was the experimental process **reliable** (consistent) and **valid** (measured what it should)? Provide a **justified discussion**.
*   Talk about the **errors** and **limitations** you found (random and systematic, controlled variables, assumptions) and **how they affected your results and conclusion**.
*   Suggest **specific ways to improve** the experiment based on the errors/limitations you found. These should be **logically derived from the analysis and evaluation**.
*   Suggest **ideas for other experiments** related to this one (extensions).

#### **Reference List**
*   List **all sources** you used (like websites, books, etc.).
*   Use **appropriate referencing conventions**.
*   Make sure you **acknowledge sources** throughout your report when you use their information (in-text citations).

*   Present it like a **scientific report**. Use **appropriate genre conventions**.
*   Use **scientific language**.
*   Aim for about **1500-2000 words**.



# Suggested improvements
### **Title**

**Shortcoming:** ❌ **Slightly wordy**; "Determining" is vague.  
**Suggestion:** ✅ **"Measuring the Angle of a Frictionless Plane Using Equilibrium Masses: Accuracy and Uncertainty Analysis"**

---

### **Research Question**

**Shortcoming:** ❌ **Ambiguous phrasing** ("altered", "adjusted") and **missing specificity** (how accuracy is compared).  
**Suggestion:** ✅ **"How accurately can the angle (θ\thetaθ) of a frictionless plane be determined by adjusting equilibrium masses (HmH_mHm​ and CmC_mCm​) compared to direct measurement with an angle gun (±1°\pm1\degree±1°)?"**

---

### **Rationale**

- ❌ **Missing explicit physics theory** (Newton’s laws → equilibrium equations).
- ❌ **Unclear link** between uncertainty reduction and modifications.  
    **Suggestion:** ✅ Add: **"Using Hm/Cm=sin⁡(θ)H_m/C_m = \sin(\theta)Hm​/Cm​=sin(θ), angle uncertainty depends on mass measurement errors (±0.01\pm0.01±0.01g) rather than the angle gun’s ±1°\pm1\degree±1°."**

---

### **Methodology**

- ❌ **Justification for variable changes** is weak.  
    **Suggestion:** ✅ **"Using HmH_mHm​ as the independent variable isolates trigonometric uncertainty to θ\thetaθ, improving precision."**
- ❌ **Method lacks detail** (e.g., how equilibrium was confirmed).  
    **Suggestion:** ✅ **"Equilibrium was confirmed when the carriage remained stationary for 5 seconds."**

---

### **Results**

- ❌ **Figure 2 (graph) lacks error bars** and **axis labels**.  
    **Suggestion:** ✅ **Add error bars for CmC_mCm​ and label axes as "HmH_mHm​ (g)" vs. "CmC_mCm​ (g)" with a trendline equation.**
- ❌ **Raw data table** is an image; **hard to read**.  
    **Suggestion:** ✅ **Embed a LaTeX table with values (see example below).**

---

### **Analysis of Evidence**

- ❌ **No quantitative uncertainty analysis** (e.g., Δθ\Delta\thetaΔθ from ΔHm/Cm\Delta H_m/C_mΔHm​/Cm​).  
    **Suggestion:** ✅ **"Using Δθ=11−(Hm/Cm)2⋅Δ(Hm/Cm)Cm\Delta\theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (H_m/C_m)^2}} \cdot \frac{\Delta(H_m/C_m)}{C_m}Δθ=1−(Hm​/Cm​)2**

- **​1​⋅Cm​Δ(Hm​/Cm​)​, maximum Δθ\Delta\thetaΔθ was 0.5°, outperforming the angle gun."**

---

### **Evaluation & Conclusion**

- ❌ **Missing evaluation** of reliability/validity.  
    **Suggestion:** ✅ **"Systematic errors (e.g., non-frictionless plane) reduced validity, but low random errors (consistent trials) ensured reliability."**
- ❌ **No comparison to theory**.  
    **Suggestion:** ✅ **"Results align with Hm=Cmsin⁡(θ)H_m = C_m\sin(\theta)Hm​=Cm​sin(θ) (R² = 0.99), confirming theoretical predictions."**

---

### **General Shortcomings**

- ❌ **In-text citations are sparse** (only one reference).  
    **Suggestion:** ✅ **Cite sources for Newton’s laws, uncertainty formulas, and frictionless plane assumptions.**
- ❌ **Word count imbalance**: Results/Discussion are underdeveloped.  
    **Suggestion:** ✅ **Expand Analysis/Evaluation to 400-500 words each.**

**Example Table for Raw Data (Replace Image):**

```
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
$H_m$ (g) & Trial 1 $C_m$ (g) & Trial 2 $C_m$ (g) & Trial 3 $C_m$ (g) \\

50.16 & 138.55 & 139.20 & 138.54 \\
