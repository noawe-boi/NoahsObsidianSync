### Research Question
What happens to *dependent variable* when **dependent variable** is changed under ***these conditions***

### Rationale 
#### Intro
The purpose of conducing the original experiment was to determine *INSERT HERE*

#### Talk about original experiment
In the original experiment we did *this* and measured what happened to **other variable**. 
It was found that *INSERT HERE*
##### Why change it?
The shortcoming of this experiment was. We decided to pivot to finding this other thing because *angle gun bad (lots of uncertainty)*

#### Explain modification
(How are we going to find angle)


Therefore, this experiment modifies the original experiment by pivoting to find *RESEARCH QUESTION*


### Method
#### Original method
What did it do?

#### Modifications
- Self explanatory


#### Management of risk
- Self explanatory

### Results
#### Raw data in spreadsheet
- Nicely Formatted excel spreadsheet with RELEVANT data
- Highlight outliers or data points that will affect results. 

#### Calculations
- Uncertainty (absolute or percentage?)
- Max/min slope findings
#### Actual Excel Graph
- Graph
- Uncertainty in gradient
- Percentage Uncertainty of gradient

#### Limitations and assumptions


### Interpretation of evidence
- Restate Research question
- State results (what was the gradient - how did $c$ change with $h$. Talk about linear relationship with gradient and how that becomes angle)
- Compare relationship to theoretical relationship

### Evaluation of experimental process
- Were measurements good
	- Uncertainty
	- How did this contribute to error?/Overall effect of assumptions
- Other sources of error
	- Where did they come from?
	- How do they affect final results?/Overall effect of assumptions

#### discussion of the reliability and validity of the experimental process

### Suggestions for improvements and extensions
#### How can the experimental process be improved?
- Equipment
- Method (data collection)


#### Conclusion
- State conclusion of data
- State reliability
