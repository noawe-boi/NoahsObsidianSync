### Claim
In the future, nuclear energy is the best possible energy source for Australia.

### Developing Research question


#### Comparing Energy Sources
**Talk about Australia net zero goal.** 



Clearly in the future, green energy is going to be Australia's main energy source. Fossil fuel sources are being phased out so there is no use mentioning them. 

Nuclear will be compared to existing green energy sources.
**Which energy source?**
- Solar (PV)
- Hydro
- Wind
- Biomass 
- Biogas

https://www.energy.gov.au/energy-data/australian-energy-statistics/renewables
Some of these , such as hydroelectric energy, do not directly compete with Nuclear energy. Scope of comparison should be limited to the most abundant energy sources that directly compete with nuclear.
From 2022-2023, the amount of energy generated from these has been 
- Solar (PV)
	- 27.3% share
	- 27% 10 year avg annual growth
- Wind
	- 20.4% share
	- 14.7% 10 year avg annual growth
- Biomass
	- 32% share
	- -0.4% 10 year average annual growth. 
	Biomass energy is produced by burning waste products from, among others,  agricultural and lumber adjacent industries. Due to this, biomass derived energy can only expand at the rate of waste generated by these industries. Furthermore, nuclear energy is not a replacement for biomass derived energy as waste products will accumulate either way. Therefore it will be considered adjacent to other energy generation industries, such as hydro, and is unsuitable for direct comparison.

Currently, solar energy is Australia's most abundant and fastest growing renewable energy source. Therefore it will be the basis of this comparison. 

#### What does 'best' mean. 

- Sustainability
	- Environment
		- Waste Disposal
	- Cost
	- Scalability
		- Infrastructure development time
		- Resource availability
		- Land usage
- Reliability

##### Cost
The cost per unit of energy produced should be considered. Cost of living is already a major issue in some parts of Australia. Lower costs associated with production will lead to lower consumer energy prices.

##### Reliability
Reliability is one of the most important factors in energy generation. If one technology demonstrates a increased reliability, this is a significant advantage.
##### Scalability
In order for a power generation technology to be competitive, it must have the ability to scale quickly and at reasonable cost. Australia urgently needs to scale carbon neutral energy to meet demand if it is to reach its target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

##### Environmental
While both energy sources require large scale mining and refinery in order to manufacture their energy generation technologies, there are stark differences in the quantity of materials required per unit of energy generated. This will impact net CO2 emissions per unit of energy, a key factor assessed when considering Australias net zero target.
