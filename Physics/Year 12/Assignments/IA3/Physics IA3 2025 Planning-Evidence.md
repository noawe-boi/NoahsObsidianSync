### Developing Research question


#### Comparing Energy Sources
**Talk about Australia net zero goal.** 



Clearly in the future, green energy is going to be Australia's main energy source. Fossil fuel sources are being phased out so there is no use mentioning them. 

Nuclear will be compared to existing green energy sources.
**Which energy source?**
- Solar (PV)
- Hydro
- Wind
- Biomass 
- Biogas

https://www.energy.gov.au/energy-data/australian-energy-statistics/renewables
Some of these , such as hydroelectric energy, do not directly compete with Nuclear energy. Scope of comparison should be limited to the most abundant energy sources that directly compete with nuclear.
From 2022-2023, the amount of energy generated from these has been 
- Solar (PV)
	- 27.3% share
	- 27% 10 year avg annual growth
- Wind
	- 20.4% share
	- 14.7% 10 year avg annual growth
- Biomass
	- 32% share
	- -0.4% 10 year average annual growth. 
	Biomass energy is produced by burning waste products from, among others,  agricultural and lumber adjacent industries. Due to this, biomass derived energy can only expand at the rate of waste generated by these industries. Furthermore, nuclear energy is not a replacement for biomass derived energy as waste products will accumulate either way. Therefore it will be considered adjacent to other energy generation industries, such as hydro, and is unsuitable for direct comparison. 
	https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/biomass/
	https://powerzone.clarkpublicutilities.com/learn-about-renewable-energy/biomass-energy/

Currently, solar energy is Australia's most abundant and fastest growing renewable energy source. Therefore it will be the basis of this comparison.

##### Cost
Energy generation requires investment at many stages during a piece of infrastructures life cycle. For a technology to be competitive, it's initial capital requirements must be low enough for the risk of construction to be deemed acceptable. Furthermore, its operational costs must be low enough for it to offer reasonable pricing to consumers.
The cost per unit of energy produced should be considered as cost of living is already a major issue in some parts of Australia. Lower costs associated with production will lead to lower consumer energy prices. This will be elaborated on.

##### Reliability
Reliability is one of the most important factors in energy generation. If one technology demonstrates a increased reliability, this is a significant advantage.
##### Scalability
In order for a power generation technology to be competitive, it must have the ability to scale quickly and at reasonable cost. Australia urgently needs to scale carbon neutral energy to meet demand if it is to reach its target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. 
https://www.dcceew.gov.au/climate-change/emissions-reduction/net-zero
##### Environmental
While both energy sources require large scale mining and refinery in order to manufacture their energy generation technologies, there are stark differences in the quantity of materials required per unit of energy generated. This will impact net CO2 emissions per unit of energy, a key factor assessed when considering Australia's net zero target.

##### LCOE (Levelised Cost of Electricity)
Initiating construction of electrical generation infrastructure is a capital intensive process. The capital spent during construction and operation must be lower than the revenue generated by the infrastructure, as well as additional profit margins, over its lifespan in order for it to be viable.
Since the sum of these costs are recuperated over the lifespan of the infrastructure, comparing them against the sum of energy the power plant will generate allows an average cost per unit of energy. This is known as the LCOE (Levelised Cost of Electricity) for that installation, and is usually measured in Watts per dollar ($W/\$$)


The CSIRO's GenCost report calculated, and predicted LCOE's for a number of technologies from the years 2024, to 2050, allowing for direct comparison of technologies.

##### Disposal Costs

#### Reliability


The prevalence and recent advancements of battery energy storage technology increases the reliability and scalability of solar PV significantly. Conventional storage technologies such as pumped storage hydropower (https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/pumped-storage-hydropower), or supplemental technologies such as wind, are usually required due to peak power generation occurring only when weather and time of day is optimal. 

While this technology is beneficial,

> > Inverter failure can occur due to a variety of factors, including age, design flaws, or electrical faults. Battery degradation is another common issue, as batteries can lose capacity over time due to repeated charge and discharge cycles. Also, the mass adoption and proliferation of GCPVS could create enormous stress on the electric grid.

One-third of the spent fuel is replaced with fresh fuel every 12 to 18 months. Constructing a nuclear power station requires a large amount of concrete, steel, copper, and aluminum, as well as diesel fuel for machinery. Decommissioning also entails significant amounts of energy. Spent fuels that are highly radioactive and continue to generate heat are stored in pools or dry storage casks at the reactor site for further reprocessing or disposal in the future (the United States does not reprocess fuel)

Average US Solar: 22-49 g CO2-eq./kWh - Avg: 46.5
Average US Nuclear: 16-55 g CO2-eq./kWh - Avg: 43.5 - **NOT CONSIDERING AUSTRALIAN URANIUM CONCENTRATIONS**

The results related to GWP in the base scenario showed that sc-Si and mc-Si systems emit 41.8 g CO2eq and 31.5 g CO2eq, respectively.
