In the future, nuclear energy is the best possible energy source for Australia.

### Developing Research question


#### Comparing Energy Sources
**Talk about Australia net zero goal.** 



Clearly in the future, green energy is going to be Australia's main energy source. Fossil fuel sources are being phased out so there is no use mentioning them. 

Nuclear will be compared to existing green energy sources.
**Which energy source?**
- Solar (PV)
- Hydro
- Wind
- Biomass 
- Biogas

https://www.energy.gov.au/energy-data/australian-energy-statistics/renewables
Some of these , such as hydroelectric energy, do not directly compete with Nuclear energy. Scope of comparison should be limited to the most abundant energy sources that directly compete with nuclear.
From 2022-2023, the amount of energy generated from these has been 
- Solar (PV)
	- 27.3% share
	- 27% 10 year avg annual growth
- Wind
	- 20.4% share
	- 14.7% 10 year avg annual growth
- Biomass
	- 32% share
	- -0.4% 10 year average annual growth. 
	Biomass energy is produced by burning waste products from, among others,  agricultural and lumber adjacent industries. Due to this, biomass derived energy can only expand at the rate of waste generated by these industries. Furthermore, nuclear energy is not a replacement for biomass derived energy as waste products will accumulate either way. Therefore it will be considered adjacent to other energy generation industries, such as hydro, and is unsuitable for direct comparison. 
	https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/biomass/
	https://powerzone.clarkpublicutilities.com/learn-about-renewable-energy/biomass-energy/

Currently, solar energy is Australia's most abundant and fastest growing renewable energy source. Therefore it will be the basis of this comparison.

##### Cost
Energy generation requires investment at many stages during a piece of infrastructures life cycle. For a technology to be competitive, it's initial capital requirements must be low enough for the risk of construction to be deemed acceptable. Furthermore, its operational costs must be low enough for it to offer reasonable pricing to consumers.
The cost per unit of energy produced should be considered as cost of living is already a major issue in some parts of Australia. High infrastructure establishment and operating costs will translate to higher prices for consumers.

##### Reliability
Reliability is one of the most important factors in energy generation. Critical sectors like healthcare and agriculture rely heavily on the grid, not to mention the millions of Australians who have improved quality of life because of it. If one technology demonstrates a increased reliability, this is a significant advantage.
##### Scalability
In order for a power generation technology to be competitive, it must have the ability to scale quickly and at reasonable cost. Australia urgently needs to scale carbon neutral energy to meet demand if it is to reach its target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. 
https://www.dcceew.gov.au/climate-change/emissions-reduction/net-zero
##### Environmental
While both energy sources require large scale mining and refinery in order to manufacture their energy generation technologies, there are stark differences in the quantity and type of materials required per installation. This will impact net CO2 emissions per unit of energy, a key factor assessed when considering Australia's net zero target.

### Research question
Is Nuclear energy more sustainable than Solar PV in terms of cost, reliability and scalability.
### Body
#### Cost 
##### LCOE (Levelised Cost of Electricity)
Initiating construction of electrical generation infrastructure is a capital intensive process. The money spent during construction and operation must be lower than the total revenue generated by the infrastructure, as well as additional profit margins, over its lifespan in order for it to be viable.
Since the sum of these costs are recuperated over the lifespan of the infrastructure, comparing them against the sum of energy the power plant will generate allows an average cost per unit of energy. This is known as the LCOE (Levelised Cost of Electricity) for that installation, and is usually measured in Watts per dollar ($W/\$$)


The CSIRO's GenCost report calculated, and predicted LCOE's for a number of technologies from the years 2024, to 2050, allowing for direct comparison of said technologies.

While the cost per megawatt hour of small modular, large scale nuclear configurations is precited to trend downwards between now and 2050, the cost of solar PV remains an average of $3.8$ times less expensive than the cheapest running nuclear options. 
##### Capital costs
This is likely due to higher capital, or setup, costs for nuclear options. Assuming mature nuclear technology is viable for construction, the cost of said large scale installations is currently $\approx \$9000/kW$ in energy generation capacity, and is expected to be as low as $\approx \$ 8000 /kW$ by 2050. 
This is much more expensive than large scale solar PV, which currently has a capital cost of $\approx\$1500/kW$, and is expected to be to $\approx \$700/kW$ by 2050.

**Analysis of a modelled grid connected PV system with on site battery storage**

*What is reliability?*
Reliability is defined as, "The ability of a system of device to carry out it's desired function under predefined circumstances for a certain amount of time" by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. Power reliability is a more specific term that refers to an entire system's ability to deliver power to consumers with sufficient quantity, and compliance with specifications.

> > Additionally, reliability is defined by Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) as the ability of a system or device to carry out its desired function under predefined circumstances for a certain amount of time. Power reliability is the extent to which the operation of a bulk system’s components results in the delivery of power to consumers within recognized criteria and in the required amount [8].

*Points of failure*
The prevalence and recent advancements of battery energy storage technology increases the reliability and scalability of solar significantly. Conventional storage technologies such as pumped storage hydropower (https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/pumped-storage-hydropower), or supplemental technologies such as wind, are required due to peak power generation occurring only when weather and time of day is optimal. 



Despite it's wide adoption, mostly due to its lower upfront cost compared to the aforementioned supplemental technologies, battery storage technology introduces a number of failure points due to its complex and decentralized nature. Batteries and battery management systems, inverters, and panels degrade over their lifespans due to factors such as temperature, humidity, and solar radiation. This is an issue because Solar PV is highly dependent on storage technologies.

> > Inverter failure can occur due to a variety of factors, including age, design flaws, or electrical faults. Battery degradation is another common issue, as batteries can lose capacity over time due to repeated charge and discharge cycles. Also, the mass adoption and proliferation of GCPVS could create enormous stress on the electric grid.

> > Environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and solar radiation can affect the reliability of a solar PV grid-connected system. High temperatures can cause module degradation and reduce the efficiency of the system. Additionally, high humidity can lead to corrosion and electrical faults. Finally, solar radiation can cause module degradation and reduce the efficiency of the system over time

Chongqing University in China aimed to investigate the power reliability of a large scale PV systems by analyzing the expected rate of failure of these devices over time and factoring in response, diagnosis and repair timelines.

As the system continued to operate, the failure rate of individual components increased linearly. It is inferred that eventually every piece of equipment would need to be replaced.

Constructing a nuclear power station requires a large amount of concrete, steel, copper, and aluminum, as well as diesel fuel for machinery. Decommissioning also entails significant amounts of energy. Spent fuels that are highly radioactive and continue to generate heat are stored in pools or dry storage casks at the reactor site for further reprocessing or disposal in the future (the United States does not reprocess fuel)

Average US Solar: 22-49 g CO2-eq./kWh - Avg: 46.5
Average US Nuclear: 16-55 g CO2-eq./kWh - Avg: 43.5 - **NOT CONSIDERING AUSTRALIAN URANIUM CONCENTRATIONS**
