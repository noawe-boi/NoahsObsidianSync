### Developing Research question
#### Comparing Energy Sources
**Talk about Australia net zero goal.** 
Clearly in the future, green energy is going to be Australia's main energy source. Fossil fuel sources are being phased out so there is no use mentioning them. 

Nuclear will be compared to existing green energy sources.
**Which energy source?**
- Solar (PV)
- Hydro
- Wind
- Biomass 
- Biogas

https://www.energy.gov.au/energy-data/australian-energy-statistics/renewables
Some of these , such as hydroelectric energy, do not directly compete with Nuclear energy. Scope of comparison should be limited to the most abundant energy sources that directly compete with nuclear.
From 2022-2023, the amount of energy generated from these has been 
- Solar (PV)
	- 27.3% share
	- 27% 10 year avg annual growth
- Wind
	- 20.4% share
	- 14.7% 10 year avg annual growth
- Biomass
	- 32% share
	- -0.4% 10 year average annual growth. 
	Biomass energy is produced by burning waste products from, among others,  agricultural and lumber adjacent industries. Due to this, biomass derived energy can only expand at the rate of waste generated by these industries. Furthermore, nuclear energy is not a replacement for biomass derived energy as waste products will accumulate either way. Therefore it will be considered adjacent to other energy generation industries, such as hydro, and is unsuitable for direct comparison.

	https://powerzone.clarkpublicutilities.com/learn-about-renewable-energy/biomass-energy/

Currently, solar energy is Australia's most abundant and fastest growing renewable energy source. Therefore it will be the basis of this comparison.

##### Cost
Energy generation requires investment at many stages during a piece of infrastructures life cycle. For a technology to be competitive, it's initial capital requirements must be low enough for the risk of construction to be deemed acceptable. Furthermore, its operational costs must be low enough for it to offer reasonable pricing to consumers.
The cost per unit of energy produced should be considered as cost of living is already a major issue in some parts of Australia. High infrastructure establishment and operating costs will translate to higher prices for consumers.

##### Reliability
Reliability is one of the most important factors in energy generation. Critical sectors like healthcare and agriculture rely heavily on the grid, not to mention the millions of Australians who have improved quality of life because of it. If one technology demonstrates a increased reliability, this is a significant advantage.
##### Scalability
Looking towards the future, the waste product of each technology must be considered. These will accumulate during generation, and at the End Of Life (EOL) period of a piece of infrastructures lifespan. If one technology shows significant advantages and becomes the dominant power generation infrastructure, the long term impact of it's materials and processes must be considered, just as they were for fossil fuels.

### Research question
Is Nuclear energy more sustainable than Solar PV in terms of cost, reliability and scalability.
### Body
#### Cost 
##### LCOE (Levelised Cost of Electricity)
Initiating construction of electrical generation infrastructure is a capital intensive process. For a project to be successful, the money spent during construction and operation, and generation must be lower than the total revenue generated by the infrastructure over its lifespan, and additional profit margins.
Since the sum of costs are recuperated over the lifespan of the infrastructure, comparing them against the sum of energy generated by the plant allows an average cost per unit of energy to be determined. This is known as the LCOE (Levelised Cost of Electricity) for that installation, and is usually measured in dollars per watt hour ($\$/Wh$). 


The CSIRO's GenCost report calculated, and predicted LCOE's for a number of technologies from the years 2024, to 2050, allowing for direct comparison of said technologies.

Clearly solar PV demonstrates the lowest LCOE, which is currently 0.16 $\$/kWh$. The closest nuclear technology to this is large scale nuclear, which is currently priced at 0.40 $\$/kWh$.While the gap between solar PV and nuclear facilities is predicted to shrink, solar is consistently predicted to be the cheapest option for the foreseeable future. 

##### Capital costs
This is likely due to higher capital, or setup, costs for nuclear options. 
The U.S Department of energy's "Capital Cost Estimates For Utility Scale Electricity Generating Plants" further breaks down these capital costs. Financing was estimated to increase capital cost by an additional $\approx 30\%$ due to the large magnitude, long term, and high risk loans required for construction. The cost of large scale nuclear in Australia is currently predicted to be $\approx \$9000/kW$ in capacity, and is expected to be as low as $\approx \$ 8000 /kW$ by 2050.

The cost of uranium fuel in America was 0.46 cents/$kWh$ in 2021. Australia is one of the largest uranium producing countries in the world, so acquiring fuel locally should hypothetically decrease this cost further, however, the cost of fuel is a only minor contributor to LOCE cost in comparison to startup. It is estimated that $60\%$ of LCOE is attributed to capital costs.  


The largest capital costs in solar PV systems are the mechanical and electrical systems, and equipment. The procurement and instillation of these components account for $\approx 80\%$ of capital costs. 
Solar PV installations are generally less expensive, and take less time to construct. This translates to lower financing fees, and an overall lower LCOE. The current capital cost of large scale solar PV in Australia is $\approx\$1500/kW$, and is expected to be $\approx \$700/kW$ by 2050. 

Solar PV's 'fuel' is sunlight, which is a free resource. While land usage scales with capacity, solar PV installations generally are have lower owner costs with respect to the total cost of the installation. Owner costs cover development, property, and other miscellaneous factors.

#### Reliability
*What is reliability?*
Reliability is defined as "The ability of a system or device to carry out it's desired function under predefined circumstances for a certain amount of time" by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
Availability is also a key factor in assessing a systems reliability. It is expressed as a fraction that describes a component or systems operating time in respect to its total lifetime.
$$\textrm{Availability} (A) = \frac{\textrm{Mean time to failure}}{\textrm {Mean time to failure + Mean downtime}}$$
Where:
- Mean time to failure is the amount of time the system operates for on average before a failure occurs
- Mean downtime is the time it takes for operations to resume after a failure occurs.

Availability and Performance Loss Factors for U.S. PV Fleet Systems by Chris Deline et al. considered availability data from large scale solar PV systems up to $\approx$ 10 $MW$. Figure X suggests the median availability (P50) decreases as system capacity grows, however, even as the system capacity surpassed 10 $MW$ median availability remained at $\approx 98\%$. 

##### Limitations




"Availability factor of a PV power plant: evaluation based on generation and inverter running periods" by Kumar, N. M., et al. considered inverter uptime in a 1000 $kW$ plant. 

The main contributor to the lowering availability was considered inverter modules, at $\approx 92\%$ available in a 1000 $kW$ system. Often there are many inverters operating in parallel, and the "Plug and play" nature of these components allow repairs to be completed quickly with minimal tools. This is also the case with many other less integral components, which results in relativity high availability for the entire system.

##### Limitations
System availability is affected by all components in the series from the PV modules to the grid. While considering a single component alone, the entire system's availability cannot be properly gauged

##### Limitations



Nuclear infrastructure faces many of the same challenges in reliability and longevity as solar PV. 

IAEA's Power Reactor Information System (PRIS) is a database of statistics regarding the construction, operation, and capacity of global nuclear energy infrastructure. Extrapolating availability from their public dataset gives a global median of $85.05\%$ (excluding South Africa). 

https://pris.iaea.org/PRIS/WorldStatistics/ThreeYrsEnergyAvailabilityFactor.aspx

This is significantly lower than solar PV systems, which seems unlikely due to solar PV relying on occasional daylight to function. However nuclear plants must abide by more stringent safety protocols, therefore more time is spent on both restorative and preventative maintenance as it must be carried out with greater frequency and meticulousness. 

For a 1000 $MW$ reactor, repair timelines range from 9, to 80 days depending on the severity of the fault. This has a significant impact on the overall availability of the system. Furthermore, while solar installations have the ability to degrade 'gracefully', maintaining partial functionality even with the loss of some system components, nuclear plants must maintain full operational capabilities to ensure safety is not compromised.
> [!PDF|yellow] [[ReliabilityPredictionForNuclearPower.pdf#page=5&selection=0,0,3,58&color=yellow|ReliabilityPredictionForNuclearPower, p. 5]]
> > For example, for a 1000 MW nuclear power unit, it takes 70 to 80 days to conduct A class repair in the rules of DL/ T838, while it takes 35 to 50 days, 26 to 30 days and 9 to 15 days, respectively to perform B, C, and D class repair.

Furthermore, the output of nuclear facilities is larger than the solar PV infrastructure discussed by a factor of 10000. Considering the decreasing trend observed in availability factor as scale increases, solar PV is hypothesised to have a lower $E_{AF}$ at the same scale as nuclear.

#### Sustainability/Waste Management

Waste generated from electricity generation is generally in the form of solid waste such as aluminium, concrete, and glass, and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) like $CO_2$. 

The waste generated by solar PV systems is approximately 1.7-2 $g$ of solid waste per $kWh$. In Australia, one recycling of these materials is complete, the lifetime $CO_2$ emissions 0.046 to 0.059 $kg$ of $CO_2$ per $kWh$. 
https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/19/solar-panel-waste-is-tiny-coal-gas-emit-hundreds-of-times-mass-per-mwh/
This is well below the internationally accepted limits of 50g of $CO_2$ (or equivalent) per $kWh$, about what a tree would absorb in a day.
https://ecotree.green/en/how-much-co2-does-a-tree-absorb

Waste generated by nuclear plants is much higher in density. A 1000 $MW$ reactor creates roughly 10 $cm^3$ of waste per $kWh$, however due to the chaotic and heterogeneous nature of nuclear reasons, the composition of nuclear waste varies. 
[[Spent Fuel Measurements.pdf]]
What remains constant though is the hazard and lifetime of spent fuel. Fission products such as strontium-90, and cesium-137 have half lives of $\approx 30$ year. Throughout its lifetime, waste will emit alpha, beta, and gamma, with the latter having the highest potential to cause harm due to its high penetrating power. To minimise potential for irradiation, spent fuel spends 1-50 years in a specialised pool. 

[[Radioactive Waste Management - World Nuclear Association.pdf]]

Due to the density of the water and the inverse square law, the spent fuel is able to decay and release heat without causing harm before being sealed in a steel and concrete containment vessel. Overall this produced 110 $g$ of $CO_2$ (equivalent)/$kWh$.
