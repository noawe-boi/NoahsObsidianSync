## What is a force?
A force is:
- *The push or pull on an object*
### Drawing Forces
Forces can be drawn or represented as arrows  or vectors 
e.g. $\rightarrow$ 

## Types or forces
### Applied Force
- Forces applied directly from one object to another
### Gravitation 
- A force between any two masses.
- Attractive force
### Normal/Reaction Force
- The force from a surface 'reacting' to the weight of an object in the opposite direction to gravity and other applied forces
- "Equal and opposite"
	- Equal in the total force applied
	- In opposite direction
i.e $F_N=F_g$
#### Notation
- $F_R$ or $F_N$ 
### Frictional Force
- The force between two surfaces in contact
- Opposes Motion
#### Notation
- $F_F$ 
###  Tension
- A force within a rope or chain
- Acts outwardly from the center
### Drag
- Wind resistance,  water resistance, etc
- A resistant force to motion through a medium
#### Effected by
- Weight 
- Mass
- Area/Volume
### Resultant/Net Force
- The overall outcome of all forces acting on an object
