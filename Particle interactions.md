## Particle interactions
### Vertex
The point at which particle interact. 
At this point they will emit or absorb new particles; deflecting one another or changing type

### Vertex location and direction
For external particles (real particles), if the particle is incoming, the vertex is on the right, and if it is outgoing the vertex is on the left. It is not always shown with a dot. The lines are drawn horizontally here to save space.

### Examples
#### Electron-Electron
![[Physics 14.2 Fenyman Diagrams 2025-07-30 09.03.11.excalidraw]]

The electrons begin to repel eachother and slow down. At a certain distance they
exchange a photon, which pushes each electron away from the other. 

With electrons, the force carrier (the photon) is created, then acts between them and disappears. It is called a ‘virtual’ photon as it only exists as long as the interaction takes place. It doesn’t have an independent
existence of its own
#### Electron-Positron
##### Bhabba scattering
![[Physics 14.2 Fenyman Diagrams 2025-07-30 09.10.55.excalidraw]]
- Electron and positron 'bounce off each other' instead of annihilating each other. 

##### Annihilation
![[Physics 14.2 Fenyman Diagrams 2025-07-30 09.14.40.excalidraw]]
- In this case, the electron and positron actually touch. 
	This creates a real photon (or pretty much raw energy in this case)

- Sometimes the photon can collapse back into an electron and positron as seen in the diagram. 

##### Quark flavour changing
![[Physics 14.2 Fenyman Diagrams 2025-07-30 09.26.16.excalidraw|800]]
The difference in charge is balanced by the emission of the boson, which decays into an [[Electron]] and Electron [[Antineutrino]]. 

#### Proton decaying into a neutron
