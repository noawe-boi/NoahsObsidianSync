### Physics Alternate sequence practice exam 2022
##### HELP
###### MC
- Q17 (bro what am i even doing. )
- **Q23b (How am i supposed to know what energy level these are at)**
	-  *They are just usually 2, 3, and 4, for hydrogen*

- **Q24 (why do we use 90-60 as the cos value instead of just 60$\degree$, Is it just the closest that counts because it can be either way and the flux will still be the same or am i tweaking?)**
	-  *Angle is measured from the normal, not the surface*
	![[Measure to normal]]

###### P2
- Q4 (is this method okay??)
#### Just revise
