### Physics Alternate sequence practice exam 2020
##### HELP
###### MC
- Q8 (where is the formula for this?)
- Q13 (answer says C, not sure why I got it wrong. also not sure why my answer is negative.)
- Q17 (bro what am i even doing. )
- Q20 (what is the person calculating these on? Why is $\frac{1}{r}$ different to just adding resistance)
- Q23b (How am i supposed to know what energy level these are at)
- Q24 (why do we use 90-60 as the cos value instead of just 60$\degree$, Is it just the closest that counts because it can be either way and the flux will still be the same or am i tweaking?)
