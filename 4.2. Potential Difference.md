Note: Chemical reactions force electrons to the negative terminal

Potential Difference, V, is the difference in electrical energy per unit charge, measured in volts


Electromotive Force (EMF) is the potential difference that is created inside a battery .It's what gives the the circuit energy 

1V = 1 J / C

therefore to find W
V = w / q
Where:
- V is voltage (potential difference)
- W is Energy (Joules)
- q is Charge (coulombs)


W = VIt
Where:
