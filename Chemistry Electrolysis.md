## What is electrolysis
Putting electricity into a cell to cause a reaction to occur, rather than a reaction occurring and producing electricity.

These reactions are non spontaneously. It must have energy put into it for a reaction to occur

### The anode and the cathode
#### Positive electrode
Oxidation is occurring on the positive electrode, or the anode.

#### Negative electrode
Reduction is occurring on the negative electrode, or cathode.

## The electrochemical series and electrolysis
Still applies
- The strongest oxidizing agent and the strongest reducing agent will react.
- However forcing non-spontaneously reactions to occur causes the 'lower' half equation be flipped.
## Purification of copper in industry
