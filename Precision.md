## Precision is the states 'level' of accuracy of a number
- e.g. 
15 + 0.3 = 15 
15.0 + 0.3 = 15.3

15 represents 15 rounded to the nearest whole number. How can a decimal point be added to an unknown value? **it cant.**

When adding and subtracting, the solution **cannot** be more precise than **any of its components**




## Examples

#### Example 1
- 15 + 0.3 = 15.3 = 15
Since 15 is rounded to the nearest whole number we have to round it to the nearest whole


#### Example 2
- 10+3 = 13 = 10
Since we are adding to 10, this means that the answer is rounded to the nearest 10. 


#### Example 3
- 3.746 -1.23 = 2.516 = 2.52
Since one of the components is only rounded to 2 decimal places, the final answer must be too.
