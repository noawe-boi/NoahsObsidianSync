The Tendency for an atom to attract a bonding electron pair
![[Excalidraw/Electronegativity]]


## Pauling Electronegativity Values

![[Electronegativity Table]]

- Pauling electronegativity values show the relative electronegativity value of each element
- Generally, electromagnetically increases as you go up, and to the right, or the periodic table. 
	- e.g. *Florine* would have a **greater** ability to attract electrons than *nitrogen* **as it has a higher number**
