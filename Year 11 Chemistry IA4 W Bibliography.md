### Research and planning

#### Considered Rationale

#### Claim

'Fossil fuels and biofuels produce carbon dioxide in their combustion'  
Evaluate the impact of fossil fuels and biofuels on the environment

##### Investigate phenomena associated with claim

##### What are Biofuels?
Biofuels are fuels created using plants or other forms of biomass. The most well known and utilised by the public are ethanol and methanol. These Biofuels are most commonly added to traditional fuels or are components in standalone alternatives.
While their ability to be sustainably produced is one of the main factors contributing to their widespread adoption, another major factor is the amounts of greenhouse gasses, such as $CO_2$, produced in their combustion.

Consider the combustion reaction for biofuel, ethanol, in comparison to it's traditional counterpart, gasoline

| Fuel     | Combustion Formula                                 | $\Delta$H      |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Ethanol  | $C_2H_5OH(l)+3O_2(g)→2CO_2(g)+3H_2O(g)$            | $-1367 kJ/mol$ |
| Gasoline | $2C_8H_{18}(l) + 25O_2(g) → 16CO_2(g) + 18H_2O(g)$ | $-2735 kJ/mol$ |

</div>

While they both resemble hydrocarbons, the amount of $CO_2$ produced when optimal combustion occurs varies significantly. The differences in molecules also result in different amounts of energy, and therefore a different change in enthalpy, and products when combustion occurs.  


$CO_2$ is a 'Greenhouse Gas', meaning that it contributes to global warming. In recent years, the amount of $CO_2$ in the atmosphere has increased significantly, causing events such a climate change (United Nations, 2004).

Unleaded gasoline and its blends are often used for transportation or non stationary machines where its high energy density can be utilised to travel large distances or alter large loads.

For the case of transportation, the amount of energy in each fuel blend can be quantified as a unit like litres per 100km ($l/100km$), and its emissions can be measured as grams of $CO_2$ per km ($g/km$).

Does the addition of biofuel, Ethanol, to unleaded gasoline produce less carbon dioxide released per kilometre in comparison to regular unleaded gasoline?

Various fuel types will be mentioned throughout this study, information regaridng these can be seen in Figure 2.

#### Analysis and interpretation

##### Source 1 
'Effects of Fuel Ethanol Use on Fuel-Cycle  
Energy and Greenhouse Gas Emissions' ,a study conducted by Argonne National Laboratory Transportation Technology R&D Center aimed to investigate, quantify, and predict the greenhouse gas emissions produced by passenger vehicles powered by both traditional petroleum, E10, E85 and E95 fuels. The study's overall goal was to predict the impact that newer refining processes would have on the total emissions generated throughout the production process as well as the burning of fuels. These predictions will be ignored, and it will be assumed that the amount of $CO_2$ produced during production is negligible across all fuels for the sake of comparison.

<div style="color:grey; font-size:16;font-family:Arial">Figure 2: A digitally alterred rendition of Figure 1, showing approximate values for CO2 alone (Argonne National Laboratory Transportation Technology R&D Center, 1999) </div>  

Figure 1 shows the measured and predicted green house gas emissions of various fuel blends in grams per mile.  
In the 'Dry, Current' column, it can be observed that $CO_2$ is the largest component in emissions and is present in all fuel blends. However, the amount of $CO_2$ in each fuel's emissions varies significantly. Regular Unleaded Gasoline released just over 475 grams $CO_2$ per mile ($295g/km$)while E95 released 37% less, at 300 grams per mile ($186g/km$).  
Since this data compares a fixed volume of $CO_2$ with an average, fixed, amount of energy, no adjustments have to be made to compensate for the lower energy-per-mole of ethanol in comparison to standard unleaded petrol.
###### Limitations
- Assumed that amount of $CO_2$ released in production is negligible.
- Unspecified driving cycle.

##### Source 2
'Comparison of emissions and fuel consumption of a passenger vehicle on two fuels', A report prepared by Prof. Michael Brear, compiles evidence relating to emissions testing conducted on a fixed passenger vehicle running standard, ULP, and biofuel, E10, fuel formulations. Tests were conducted in a standardised 'test cell' and performed over the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), a set load series created to benchmark many aspects of vehicles.

![[Pasted image 20240907152140.png]]

<div style="color:grey; font-size:16;font-family:Arial">Figure 4: Cumulative emissions for Holden Captive vehicle over NEDC cycle while running on ULP and E10 (Brear, 2016)</div>  

Figure 4 is a table containing the results from the study's emissions tests. It can be observed that on average, E10, relative to ULP, shows a decrease in grams of $CO_2$ released per 100 km from $\approx 234g/km$ to $\approx 223g/km$, which equates to a 5$\%$ decrease in $CO_2$ emissions.  
While the reduced fuel economy, or total energy extracted per litre of fuel, does seem intuitive based on the lower energy per mole of ethanol, the study claims that this difference is negligible, so it will be treated as such.
###### Limitations
- Single vehicle sample size
- Limited number of trials

##### Source 3
The joint study, 'Effect of Fuel Ethanol Content on Exhaust Emissions of a Flexible Fuel Vehicle', conducted by the Transport and Air Quality Unit and Institute for Environment and Sustainability, investigated the differences in emissions of a fuel flexible vehicle. A fuel flexible vehicle is a vehicle that is able to properly operate when running on fuels with ethanol content ranging from 0%, to 85% (US Department of Energy, n.d.). The study tested 3 types of fuel, ULP, E10, and E85, against multiple load, or driving, cycles


![[Pasted image 20240907152018.png]]

<div style="color:grey; font-size:16px;font-family:Arial">Figure 6: Percentage variation of emissions compared to standard ULP, considered baseline (Larsen & Westbrook, 2012)</div>  

Figure 6 is a table that compares the percentage difference in total quantity of various emission components produced throughout each driving cycle, against the type of fuel burned. It should be noted that all statistics marked with a red asterisk (<span style="color:red">*</span>) are considered to be statistically significant with high confidence. ULP is not listed as a fuel as it was considered the baseline, in which all other percentage values are with respect to.

In every test, E10's $CO_2$ emissions varied only marginally when compared to ULP. This difference was greatest in the UDC, and EUDC driving cycles, where it varied from -3%, to 1%.  
E85, however, showed slight deviation from baseline results in all driving cycles. $CO_2$ emissions were decreased by a maximum of 5%, and a minimum of 4% in the UDC, and both NEDC and EUDC driving cycles respectively. E85

<div style="color:grey; font-size:16px;font-family:Arial">Figure 7: CO2 emissions over various load cycles (g/km) (Larsen & Westbrook, 2012)</div>  
The same study provided a quantitative graph of results over the same cycles, with the "Combined" results representing the entire NEDC load cycle. These results are relevant for later analysis.  

While the difference between ULP, the containing no ethanol, and E85, containing the most ethanol, was at most 5%, the study does consider these results statistically significant with a high level of confidence, in which case the evidence supports the thesis that the addition of ethanol to ULP decreases $CO_2$ emissions.


###### Limitations
- Single vehicle sample size
- Only 3 back to back test for each fuel in each cycle.

#### Conclusion and Evaluation

![[Pasted image 20240910190937.png]]

<div style="color:grey; font-size:16px;font-family:Arial">Figure 9: % Decerase of CO2 emissions over % ethanol by volume of fuel used  
</div>  
This study aimed to evaluate and compare the relationship between the reasonably extractable energy and quantify of $CO_2$ produced during combustion of both a traditional, and biofuel.  
The evidence presented appeared to indicate that addition of biofuel, ethanol, reduced $CO_2$ emissions by a measurable, and statistically significant, amount, when compared to its traditional counterpart, Unleaded Gasoline, alone.  
##### Justified Conclusions linked to research question  
Therefore, it can be concluded that the addition of biofuel, Ethanol, to unleaded gasoline, does in fact, produce less carbon dioxide released per kilometre in comparison to regular unleaded gasoline. Thus supporting the research question.  

While the individual studies and figures referenced clearly demonstrate the same trend, when compared against each other there was significant deviation in their values.  
![[Pasted image 20240910180641.png]]

<div style="color:grey; font-size:16px;font-family:Arial">Figure 8: CO2 emissions over various load cycles (g/km) (Argonne National Laboratory Transportation Technology R&D Center, 1999; Brear, 2016; Larsen & Westbrook, 2012)</div>  

Figure 8 clearly demonstrates this and shows that even for the same fuel, the amount of $CO_2$ per kilometre varied significantly. For example, E10's value varies by over $117 g/km$ with Figure 1 having the largest value, and Figure 7 having the smallest.  
This is likley due to 3 main factors. The first factor is the differences in vehicle used during testing. (Argonne National Laboratory Transportation Technology R&D Center, 1999) did not list a motor vehicle and aimed for an average value. (Brear, 2016) utilized a Holden GCG Captiva 7, a mid sized SUV. (Larsen & Westbrook, 2012) utilised a Ford Focus 1.8 Duratec Flexi-fuel, a mid sized hatchback. All of these vehicles have significant variance in their weight, engine type, aerodynamics and overall efficiency.  
The second factor is the lack or direct, quantified results. All quantities were visually estimated using figures and graphs from the study, many of which were unlabelled. This introduced significant uncertainty and could have contributed to inaccuracy.

All studies and data referenced were based around the NEDC, which is driven 'hot'. It could be beneficial to investigate the emissions generated during the first minutes of a drive, where the vehicle is considered 'cold' as it is a known that fuels that have high ethanol content are less effective in these conditions due to their higher vaporisation energy cost ([https://eflexfuel.com/us/blog/do-cars-using-e85-start-in-the-cold](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Feflexfuel.com%2Fus%2Fblog%2Fdo-cars-using-e85-start-in-the-cold)), as well as the fact that shorter trips may not give the engine the opportunity to 'warm up'.

While the evidence utilised in this study did include data with fuels containing up to 95% ethanol by volume, only a single paper had data on it. a possible extension to this study could investigate whether there is an optimal ethanol content by using data that included a variety of fuels with varying % ethanol by volume, and other additives.

Finally, it should be mentioned that $CO_2$ is not the only pollutant resulting form the burning of fuels such as ethanol and unleaded gasoline. Further studies should focus on a broader range of compounds, their abundance, and impact on the environment.
