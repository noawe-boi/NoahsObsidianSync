Title: Yeah pretty much as good as you're gonna get

**Photos:** 
**While the first photo is pretty cool looking, It's pretty dark and doesn't really let me know what car I'm looking at. Most people aren't going to know what the car looks like based on the model. I'd get another cool looking photo to use as the cover and place those ones further down. I can't find the ones I took for chads car but they were pretty much the same shots as you have now but better lighting (sunet) with my canon camera. They came out a bit better.** 

**Description:**

*2003 e320 Mercedes Body and engine is in good condition. Most the k’s have been highway. It’s just had brand new continental￼ tires and brakes. It has a clear title and rego till August. I am second owner. The SBS pump was changed when bought at 180000kms and the engine has been serviced on time every time. This car is a pet free and clean environment car which has been very well looked after.*

**Firstly, I like how you started with the model, but i feel like the average person on marketplace ain't reading allat**

**We need that as dot points because there are a lot of lazy mfs out there**

**I like this section, It's pretty brief and keeps it simple. I do wonder whether you should mention if the sunroof opens or it motorised in any way. I cant remember and if it IS then its a pretty cool selling point. **

**At the end I think we'll have a lot of dot points which is okay. I think people will message you if they have any other questions. If you're not feeling like a car salesman then this is probably what you want because the listing will do all the talking for you.** 
**I dont think the steering wheel cover is that big of a selling point and neither is the carbon fiber wrapped interior**
