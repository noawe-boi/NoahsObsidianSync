##### Challenges I will face, and how I will overcome them
**Adapting to the new environment/being away from home**
	I have not experienced changes in my environment and lifestyle to this degree in my life. While my transition to senior high school did require me to make major changes to how I spend my time, and develop discipline in my studies, my general environment did not change. I feel independent enough to travel alone, as I have done to visit family in newcastle, and have spend weeks away from my family at a time at STEM competitions and school trips. I believe that for anyone my age, major changes like this are imminent. Some of my previous friends, who graduated last year or finished in grade 10, have to face the transition into university, or trade. I don't see why this would be any different. As long as I know what is expected of me, and have a clear idea of the future, I do not think this will be detrimental to my success in the ADF. I am nowhere near the first in my family to leave home for extended periods such as this. I have a little brother who I feel can fill my shoes pretty well. I think my parents will miss me, considering the fact that I may not be able to contact them, some time apart will not jeopardise our lives. Even though I may feel lonely at times, I will have lots of fellow recruits that are going through the exact same thing as me, and thus we will prevail together.
**TODO**
Embracing the new culture
	I've attended a private school for my entire education, and thus had to adopt a strict school culture and adhere to school policy. I already take pride in wearing a well kept uniform, and follow a schedule, both in and, and to a lesser extent, out of school. It is important to me that I represent my school appropriate, as inappropriate behaviour not only results in punishments, but affects my reputation and the reputation of my school. When I represented my school in the F1 in school STEM competition, we were expected to act professionally, and network with any other teams or possible sponsors we interacted with. 
**TODO**
Finding new mates
	While I have spent my education hanging around with the same group of people, I think it will be difficult initially difficult to find a group, or break the ice with new people. However, during my time in STEM competitions, I have had success in this, and found many people I could relate to, and share common ground with. During my ADF testing, I had some good chats with the other candidates. I think structured environments, such as that STEM competition, and the waiting room, allow people to find common ground with one another, and thus break the ice and become comfortable around one another. Thus I believe I will be able to overcome this challenge.

## The Officer Selection Board

If you intend to apply for entry as an Officer and you successfully pass the JOA, CC Session and Assessment
Sessions, you will be required to appear before an Officer Selection Board (OSB). Recruiting needs to be satisfied
that you have leadership potential and that you have the individual abilities considered critical to the role of an
Officer in the ADF. The individual Service makes this determination through the OSB.
The OSB consists of a series of activities designed to test aspects such as leadership, teamwork and individual
abilities, as well as a range of challenging problem-solving exercises designed to test your competitiveness for
available vacancies. The OSB usually consists of a number of activities including:
- Oral presentation
- Formal interviews (all positions and Services)
- Attend Aviation Screening Program (ASP) for all avenues of entry for Pilots and Mission Aircrew
The formal interviews will be conducted before a panel of Officers usually including:
- President (ADF member)
- Specialist Officer (ADF member)
- Psychologist
The OSB will offer you the opportunity to make a favourable impression upon the Board. Whilst Board members
will make allowances for applicants who are nervous, and will do their best to put them at ease, they will expect you
to overcome and control nervousness and present yourself in the best light.
The following are points for you to consider to improve your presentation:
- Pay careful attention to dress and grooming–first impressions are important
- Be confident and sell yourself
- Answer all questions completely and honestly
- Think before you speak
- Listen carefully; be alert and responsive at all times
To help you prepare for the OSB, you are encouraged to attend an OSB Information Session. Your attendance is
not a requirement of the recruiting process but is recommended to assist in your progress. There are many
questions you must ask yourself before applying for an appointment as an Officer. You must be absolutely sure
that you really want to be an Officer in the ADF, and know the reasons why. Careful preparation is essential to
ensure a knowledgeable and confident presentation at interviews and the OSB. There are some websites listed
below which may assist with your preparation.
