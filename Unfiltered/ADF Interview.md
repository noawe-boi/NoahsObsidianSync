##### Challenges I will face, and how I will overcome them
Adapting to the new environment/being away from home
	I have not experienced changes in my environment and lifestyle to this degree in my life. While my transition to senior high school did require me to make major changes to how I spend my time, and develop discipline in my studies, my general environment did not change. I feel independent enough to travel alone, as I have done to visit family in newcastle, and have spend weeks away from my family at a time at STEM competitions and school trips. I believe that for anyone my age, major changes like this are imminent. Some of my previous friends, who graduated last year or finished in grade 10, have to face the transition into university, or trade. I don't see why this would be any different. As long as I know what is expected of me, and have a clear idea of the future, I do not think this will be detrimental to my success in the ADF. I am nowhere near the first in my family to leave home for extended periods such as this. I have a little brother who I feel can fill my shoes pretty well. I think my parents will miss me, but keeping contact with them while adjusting, as I have done in the past while away, should help both of us transition. 
Embracing the new culture
	I've attended a private school for my entire education, and thus had to adopt a strict school culture and adhere to school policy. I already take pride in wearing a well kept uniform, and follow a schedule, both in and, and to a lesser extent, out of school. It is important to me that I represent my school appropriate, as inappropriate behaviour not only results in punishments, but affects my reputation and the reputation of my school. When I represented my school in the F1 in school STEM competition, we were expected to act professionally, and network with any other teams or possible sponsors we interacted with. There was an instance where another team at our same school acted unprofessionally in communications with a possible sponsor (promising too much, going back on what they said, talking casually in enail), and this resulted in them being cut off. 
Finding new mates
	While I have spent my education hanging around with the same group of people, I think it will be difficult initially difficult to find a group, or break the ice with new people. However, during my time in STEM competitions, I have had success in this, and found many people I could relate to, and share common ground with. During my ADF testing, I had some good chats with the other candidates. I think structured environments, such as that STEM competition, and the waiting room, allow people to find common ground with one another, and thus break the ice and become comfortable around one another. Thus I believe I will be able to overcome this challenge.
