### Parts 
- Pi Pico (ECU)
	- Possibly get wifi enabled version for app control or control over serial. 
- Coil for spark
- Hall effect sensors
- small polarized magnets
- Connectors 
- Servos for carb control
- Tube for MAFS (remember to make it perfectly balanced)

#### MAFS
##### Hot wire temp measurement
###### Pros
- More accurate (allegedly)
- Not affected by vibrations of engine and setup
- More software dependent rather than hardware dependent

###### Cons
- Harder to implement
- Require's more logic
- Requires transistors and propper temperature control for wire
- Need to figure out how to measure wire temp
##### Mechanical flap
###### Pros


###### Cons
