### Weird relationships
Using only trial 1 values somewhat improves


### ToDo

### Rationale
- [ ] Justify modifications and talk about them... I completely forgot to do this.
- [ ] Talk about nernst equation



#### Results
#### Outliers
- [x] Set up actual final results in excel
- [x] Graph final results in desmos
	- [x] Change latex graph to match
- [x] Add uncertainty to graph as error bars
- [x] Add cool table as ===APPENDIX===
#### Analysis of evidence
- [x] Use of algorithms.
- [x] Visual and graphical representation of data.
- [x] Identification of trends, patters, and/or relationships.
- [x] Identification of uncertainty and limitations of evidence.
- [x] Talk about outliers.

This is supported by theory, as when $\lim\limits_{[Cu^{2+}]\rightarrow 0}$, $E_\textrm{cell}\rightarrow 0$, as without another electrolyte facilitate the transfer of ions, the cell would have no potential. This suggests an incorrect hypothesis or error in procedure. Furthermore, it is unknown whether this relationship holds for higher $[Cu^{2+}]$ values.
