### Developing Research question
#### Comparing Energy Sources
In the current age, the use of fossil fuels is falling under increasing levels of scrutiny both due to dwindling supply and looming "net zero" deadlines. While nuclear energy is certainly a possible source of renewable energy in the future, the claim that **"In the future, nuclear energy is the best possible energy source for Australia"** seems to be an opinion of many in the space, and warrants investigation. By comparing nuclear energy options to the best options that are currently implemented, a comparison can be made. 

Other energy sources currently implemented, such as hydroelectric energy, do not directly compete with Nuclear energy. Biomass in particular is limited in growth by the rate of biomass waste generated by industry (EIA, 2024). Therefore the scope of comparison is limited to the most abundant and fast growing energy sources that directly compete with nuclear.

| Energy Generation Technology | Current Share (%) | Current Annual Growth (%) | Average growth over last 10 years (%) |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------------------ |
| Solar Photovoltaic (PV)      | 27.3%             | 21%                       | 27.1%                                 |
| Wind&nbsp;                   | 20.4%             | 7.8%                      | 14.7%                                 |
| Biomass<br>                  | 32%               | 3.9%                      | -0.4%                                 |
| Hydro                        | 10.8%             | -2%                       | -0.9%                                 |
**Table 1:** *Current share and growth of select energy sources in respect to total renewable share* (Australian Government, 2023).

Solar PV demonstrates the second highest share in electricity generation, and is currently the fastest growing renewable energy.  Therefore it will be the basis of this comparison. 
#### Categories of comparison
##### Cost
Energy generation requires investment at many stages during a piece of infrastructures life cycle. Contributors to cost will be discussed. The cost per unit of energy produced should be considered as cost of living is a major issue in some parts of Australia (Potts, 2024).
##### Reliability
Critical sectors like healthcare and agriculture rely heavily on the grid, in addition to the millions of Australians who have improved quality of life because of it. If one technology demonstrates a increased reliability, this is a significant advantage.
##### Scalability
Looking towards the future, the waste product of each technology must be considered. These will accumulate during generation, and at the End Of Life (EOL) period of infrastructures lifespan. If one technology shows significant advantages and becomes the dominant power generation infrastructure, the long term impact of it's materials and processes must be considered, just as they were in the case of fossil fuels (DCCEEW, 2025).
### Research question
Is Nuclear Energy more sustainable than Solar Photovoltaic (PV) in terms of cost, reliability and long term waste production?
#### Cost 
##### LCOE (Levelised Cost of Electricity)
Initiating construction of electrical generation infrastructure is a capital intensive process. For a project to be successful, the money spent during construction and operation, and generation must be lower than the total revenue generated by the infrastructure over its lifespan, and additional profit margins.
Since the sum of costs are recuperated over the lifespan of the infrastructure, comparing them against the sum of energy generated by the plant allows an average cost per unit of energy to be determined. This is known as the LCOE (Levelised Cost of Electricity) for that installation, and is usually measured in dollars per watt hour ($\$/Wh$). 

The CSIRO's GenCost report calculated, and predicted LCOE's for a number of technologies from the years 2024, to 2050, allowing for direct comparison of said technologies (Graham et al., 2024).

**Figure 1:** *Calculated LCOE by technology and category for 2024 to 2050 (AUD)* (Graham et al., 2024).

##### Limitations
These predictions are based on current policies and discounts applied to renewable infrastructures.

Clearly solar PV demonstrates the lowest LCOE, being 0.16 $\$/kWh$ (as shown in Figure 1). The closest nuclear technology to this is large scale nuclear, which is currently has costs of 0.40 $\$/kWh$. While the gap between solar PV and nuclear facilities is predicted to shrink, solar is consistently predicted to be the cheapest option for the foreseeable future. This is likely due to higher capital, or setup, costs for nuclear infrastructure
##### Capital costs
![[{DAAF901C-5442-4AD5-8B55-970D45E2861D}.png|600]] 
**Figure 3:** *Capital cost estimates for Advanced Nuclear* (Leidos Engineering, LLC, 2016).

The U.S Department of energy's "*Capital Cost Estimates For Utility Scale Electricity Generating Plants*" further breaks down these capital costs. 

While fresh fuel is benign, as fission has not yet been initiated, spent fuel requires specialised equipment and procedures to be safely handled. Spent fuel poses not just a hazard to people, but the plant. If fresh fuel is not isolated from spent, it can induce fission and begin a chain reaction. 


![[Pasted image 20250729163514.png|600]]
**Figure 4:** *Diagram of nuclear fission, or splitting of the atom* (Linquip Team, 2023).

When neutron induced fission occurs, a neutron transmutates an atom from a stable isotope, to an unstable isotope, causing it to split and eject additional neutrons, as well as other nuclei. The splitting of the atom produces heat, and the ejected neutrons continue the reaction.  

Neutron counters are placed throughout the plant in order to detect radiation contamination, and thick shielding is utilised to prevent neutrons or other radiation from penetrating through containment vessels, or into other sections of the plant (World Nuclear Association, 2022). This results in $38\%$ of total costs being associated with engineering, materials and construction (excluding any mechanical or electrical equipment)  (Leidos Engineering, LLC, 2016). 

The cost of large scale nuclear in Australia is currently predicted to be $\approx \$9000/kW$ in capacity, and is expected to be as low as $\approx \$ 8000 /kW$ by 2050 (Graham et al., 2024).

The cost of uranium fuel in America was 0.46 cents/$kWh$ in 2021 (Leidos Engineering, LLC, 2016). Acquiring fuel locally should hypothetically decrease this cost further, however, the cost of fuel is a only minor contributor to LOCE. It is estimated that $60\%$ of LCOE is attributed to capital costs (World Nuclear Association, 2020).

The largest capital costs in solar PV systems are the mechanical and electrical systems, and equipment. The procurement and instillation of these components account for $\approx 80\%$ of capital costs (Leidos Engineering, LLC, 2016).

**Figure 5:** *Capital cost estimates for Advanced Solar PV (with tracking)* (Leidos Engineering, LLC, 2016).

Solar PV installations are generally less expensive, and take less time to construct. This translates to lower financing fees, and an overall lower LCOE. The current capital cost of large scale solar PV in Australia is $\approx\$1500/kW$, and is expected to be $\approx \$700/kW$ by 2050 (Graham et al., 2024).

Solar PV's 'fuel' is sunlight, which is a free resource. While land usage scales with capacity, solar PV installations generally are have lower owner costs with respect to the total cost of the installation. Owner costs cover development, property, and other miscellaneous factors (World Nuclear Association, 2024).

#### Reliability
Reliability is defined as "The ability of a system or device to carry out it's desired function under predefined circumstances for a certain amount of time" by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (Obatola, 2024).
Availability is also a key factor in assessing a systems reliability. It is expressed as a fraction that describes a component or systems operating time in respect to its total lifetime. (Sayed et al., 2019)
$$\textrm{Availability} (A) = \frac{\textrm{Mean time to failure}}{\textrm {Mean time to failure + Mean downtime}}$$
Where:
- Mean time to failure is the amount of time the system operates for on average before a failure occurs
- Mean downtime is the time it takes for operations to resume after a failure occurs.

![[Pasted image 20250728070312.png|700]]

**Figure 4:** *System availability versus system size shows negative trend. P50 (red) and P90 (black) quantile values shown.*

"*Availability and Performance Loss Factors for U.S. PV Fleet Systems*" by Chris Deline et al. considered availability data from large scale solar PV systems up to $\approx$ 10 $MW$ (10000 $kW$). Figure 4 suggests the median availability (P50) decreases as system capacity grows, however, even as the system capacity surpassed 10 $MW$ median availability remained at $\approx 98\%$ (Deline et al., 2024).
##### Limitations
It should be considered though that climate of America varies significantly from Australia in terms of temperature and humidity. This will affect the rate at which systems degrade and fail, therefore the applicability of this data is limited. 


"*Availability factor of a PV power plant: evaluation based on generation and inverter running period*s" by Kumar, N. M., et al. considered inverter uptime in a 1000 $kW$ plant.

The main contributor to the lowering availability was considered inverter modules, at $\approx 92\%$ available in a 1000 $kW$ system. Often there are many inverters operating in parallel, and the "Plug and play" nature of these components allow repairs to be completed quickly with minimal tools. This is also the case with many other less integral components, which results in relativity high availability for the entire system (Sayed et al., 2019)
##### Limitations
System availability is affected by all components in the series from the PV modules to the grid. While considering a single component alone, the entire system's availability cannot be properly gauged







Nuclear infrastructure faces many of the same challenges in reliability and longevity as solar PV.
IAEA's Power Reactor Information System (PRIS) is a database of statistics regarding the construction, operation, and capacity of global nuclear energy infrastructure. Extrapolating availability from their public dataset gives a global median of $85.05\%$ (excluding South Africa) (Iaea.org, 2022).


This is significantly lower than solar PV systems, which seems unlikely due to solar PV relying on occasional daylight to function. However nuclear plants must abide by more stringent safety protocols, therefore more time is spent on both restorative and preventative maintenance as it must be carried out with greater frequency and meticulousness.

For a 1000 $MW$ reactor, repair timelines range from 9, to 80 days depending on the severity of the fault (Shi & Wang, 2016). Additionally, nuclear plants must schedule downtime to replace fuel rods and handle spent fuel every 3-5 years. 

##### Limitations

It should be considered that the output of nuclear facilities is larger relative to solar PV infrastructure discussed by a factor of at least 100 times. Considering the decreasing trend observed in availability factor as scale increases, solar PV is hypothesised to have a lower $E_{AF}$ at the same scale as nuclear.



#### Sustainability/Waste Management

Waste generated from electricity generation is generally in the form of solid waste such as aluminium, concrete, and glass, and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) like $CO_2$.

The waste generated by solar PV systems is approximately 1.7-2 $g$ of solid waste per $kWh$. In Australia, one recycling of these materials is complete, the lifetime $CO_2$ emissions 0.046 to 0.059 $kg$ of $CO_2$ per $kWh$ (Barnard, 2025).
This is well below the internationally accepted limits of 50g of $CO_2$ (or equivalent) per $kWh$, about what a tree would absorb in a day (EcoTree, 2022).

Waste generated by nuclear plants is much higher in density. A 1000 $MW$ reactor creates roughly 10 $cm^3$ of waste per $kWh$, however due to the chaotic and heterogeneous nature of nuclear reasons, the composition of nuclear waste varies.

What remains constant though is the hazard and lifetime of spent fuel. Fission products such as strontium-90, and cesium-137 have half lives of $\approx 30$ years (World Nuclear Association, 2022). Spent fuel contains up to $50\%$ of its original energy (World Nuclear Association, 2022).  To minimise potential for irradiation, spent fuel spends up to 50 years in a shielded pool where they continue to undergo fission in a controlled environment.

Due to the density of the water and the inverse square law, the spent fuel is able to decay and release heat without causing harm before being sealed in a steel and concrete containment vessel. verall this produces 110 $g$ of $CO_2$ (equivalent)/$kWh$.

##### Limitations





## Discussion
### Extrapolation/Summary of credible findings

In terms of cost, solar was clearly the better option. Nuclear energy is simply too complex and monolithic to be considered viable at this point in time. 

Solar was found to be more reliable mostly due to its resilience against minor damage and its limited seriality. Nuclear energy is simply too bureaucratic and has too many risks, and therefore spends a larger portion of its lifespan managing them through preventative maintenance and diagnostics. 


In terms of waste, solar PV is more sustainable as it's waste products are easily recycled and have smaller $CO_2$ emissions. Nuclear infrastructure appears to induce more cost managing waste products than creating useful output for consumers. Increasing the output and number of nuclear plants will produce more waste, it is almost the antithesis of sustainability; there is an overabundance of waste product so that in the future, energy production may be limited not by lack of fuel, but waste containment saturation. 
### Improvements and extensions

While solar was found to be the more feasible energy source, wind is closely related to it, and operates fairly similar. Investigation of less abundant technologies such as wind could yield useful results. 

Furthermore, investigation of supplemental of hybrid infrastructure could be worthwhile. It is foolish to assume that grid systems can only contain a single form of energy generation technology, and the addition of other technologies in parallel would likely increase the reliability of both. 

## Conclusion
The term "Nuclear fantasy" itself, appears to be a reality. Solar PV infrastructure appears to have been implemented with its current magnitude for good reason. The claim **"In the future, nuclear energy is the best possible energy source for Australia"** has been disprove through answering the research question **"Is Nuclear Energy more sustainable than Solar Photovoltaic (PV) in terms of cost, reliability and long term waste production?"** with 'No'.
