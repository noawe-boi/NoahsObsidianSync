### What are they


### Structure
Amino acids all share the same head, and general structure
Considering the diagram, we can see the $R$ group represents the unique portion of the [[Amino]] acid

### Trivia
- Plants produce all 20 amino acids, we can only synthesize 10. We require dietary supplementation to get the remaining 10. 

### Proteins and amino acids
By transferring the hydrogen atom to the $NH$ group from the $COOH$ group, the ends become highly attractive and the molecule becomes very polar. This allows [[Polymer]]s to form.
