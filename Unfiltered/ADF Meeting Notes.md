### Preamble
Sorry about last time. my chemistry teacher is a bit of a yarner and I completley forgot. I guess you heard my voicemail too.



### Why ADF?
#### Interest in mechanics/electronics
- Been taking things apart since I was little
- Interest in systems
	- Made by many people to acheive a single goal. 
	- Why are things the way they are (what decisions were made during the design process)

#### University
- Considering doing engineering degree with ADF however unsure whether I'll enjoy life in the ADF. 
- This is a good way or me to get a feel for what it's like, while learning about a field I'm interested in along the way. 



## Meeting 2
### My current stance
I was really excited initially after you helped access the resources about the roles, but after considering it, ==I don't think I want my first commitment to be over a year==. From there I could see myself transitioning into ADFA potentially (even though its difficult) or into a trade maintaining role (like **Aircraft Technician Full Time**). 

**I was, and still am enthusiastic about the aircraft support technician gap year role**, but I believe that we discussed how it is unavailable currently. I was also enthusiastic, about mechanical and electronic engineering gap year roles in the navy, but after reviewing my job opportunities assessment, I found I as not eligible for these jobs. 

I remember we discussed possible eligibility for promotion to other roles, but I'm unsure what specifically this meant. 

### Where to go from here? 
If there is the possibility that I can get qualified to pursue any of the engineering gap years I am very interested. If there is not, then if the aviation support technician gap year becomes available then I am ready and willing to pursue it.
