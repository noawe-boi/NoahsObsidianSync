## Background
Explore the chemical synthesis of a biofuel produced from agae and its comparison with existing fuel sources

### What are algal fuels?
In the case of First, and Second generation biofuels, the starting materials were either edible food sources, or competed with edible food stock for land. Third generation biofuels derived from micro algae are a recent development, and differ from their predecessors as they can be grown in aquatic environments, or in condensed production plants. This reduces their impact on food production, but comes with its own set of challenges. Furthermore, processing of third generation fuels is easier due to lack of cellulose or other resilient components. A number of existing products can be derived from third generation biofuels, such as ethanol and biogas, however new products can now be considered viable due the high oil content of some algal strains. One of these new products is biogasoline, a biofuel product with very similar hydrocarbon content to its fossil fuel counterpart, gasoline.
