### Introduction
Senior assassin: The best excuse for reckless driving, gang stalking, and armed assault since...
The idea is simple. 
- You are given a target and can see their location on a map and must assassinate them with some form of liquid, but specifically not bodily fluids. 
- To make it somewhat possible to find them, everyone downloads an app which allows them to see their targets location. This location updates every 10 minutes but can be hidden with powers ups. 
- Power ups are placed around the real world and to collect them, you pretty much have to play Pokemon go with the power up and physically travel to it. 
-  These differed in function from defensive power ups, like temporary immunity, location hiding, and bounty clearing, to offensive power ups, like bounties, and the purge. 
- All assassinations must be recorded for them to count, and you arent allowed to asassinate people while theyre driving
