### What is my leadership style?
I feel as if my leadership style is closest to being consulting. While we ultimately all work towards achieving much broader goals, the process to achieving them does not have to be strictly autocratic. I believe that while a leader should provide a sense of direction and management to those they lead, they must also allow for freedom and expression during completion of tasks. There are usually diamonds in the rough, as each individuals experience and insights can allow them to excel in certain areas, and improve outcomes in the present and future, assuming that their followers are acting in good faith.
