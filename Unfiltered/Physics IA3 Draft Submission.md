## Comparing Energy Sources

**Talk about Australia net zero goal.**

Clearly in the future, green energy is going to be Australia's main energy source. Fossil fuel sources are being phased out so there is no use mentioning them.

Nuclear will be compared to existing green energy sources.  
**Which energy source?**

- Solar (PV)
    
- Hydro
    
- Wind
    
- Biomass
    
- Biogas
    

Some of these, such as hydroelectric energy, do not directly compete with Nuclear energy. Scope of comparison should be limited to the most abundant energy sources that directly compete with nuclear.

From 2022–2023, the amount of energy generated from these has been:

- Solar (PV)
    
    - 27.3% share
        
    - 27% 10 year avg annual growth
        
- Wind
    
    - 20.4% share
        
    - 14.7% 10 year avg annual growth
        
- Biomass
    
    - 32% share
        
    - -0.4% 10 year average annual growth.
        

Biomass energy is produced by burning waste products from, among others, agricultural and lumber adjacent industries. Due to this, biomass derived energy can only expand at the rate of waste generated by these industries. Furthermore, nuclear energy is not a replacement for biomass derived energy as waste products will accumulate either way. Therefore it will be considered adjacent to other energy generation industries, such as hydro, and is unsuitable for direct comparison.

Currently, solar energy is Australia's most abundant and fastest growing renewable energy source. Therefore it will be the basis of this comparison.

### Cost

Energy generation requires investment at many stages during a piece of infrastructures life cycle. For a technology to be competitive, its initial capital requirements must be low enough for the risk of construction to be deemed acceptable. Furthermore, its operational costs must be low enough for it to offer reasonable pricing to consumers.

The cost per unit of energy produced should be considered as cost of living is already a major issue in some parts of Australia. High infrastructure establishment and operating costs will translate to higher prices for consumers.

### Reliability

Reliability is one of the most important factors in energy generation. Critical sectors like healthcare and agriculture rely heavily on the grid, not to mention the millions of Australians who have improved quality of life because of it. If one technology demonstrates an increased reliability, this is a significant advantage.

### Scalability

In order for a power generation technology to be competitive, it must have the ability to scale quickly and at reasonable cost. Australia urgently needs to scale carbon neutral energy to meet demand if it is to reach its target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

### Environmental

While both energy sources require large scale mining and refinery in order to manufacture their energy generation technologies, there are stark differences in the quantity and type of materials required per installation. This will impact net CO2 emissions per unit of energy, a key factor assessed when considering Australia's net zero target.

Is Nuclear energy more sustainable than Solar PV in terms of cost, reliability and scalability?

## Cost

### LCOE (Levelised Cost of Electricity)

Initiating construction of electrical generation infrastructure is a capital intensive process. The money spent during construction and operation must be lower than the total revenue generated by the infrastructure, as well as additional profit margins, over its lifespan in order for it to be viable.

Since the sum of these costs are recuperated over the lifespan of the infrastructure, comparing them against the sum of energy the power plant will generate allows an average cost per unit of energy. This is known as the LCOE (Levelised Cost of Electricity) for that installation, and is usually measured in Watts per dollar ($W/$)

While the cost per megawatt hour of small modular, large scale nuclear configurations is predicted to trend downwards between now and 2050, the cost of solar PV remains an average of 3.8 times less expensive than the cheapest running nuclear options.

### Capital costs

This is likely due to higher capital, or setup, costs for nuclear options. Assuming mature nuclear technology is viable for construction, the cost of said large scale installations is currently ≈ $9000/kW in energy generation capacity, and is expected to be as low as ≈ $8000 /kW by 2050.

This is much more expensive than large scale solar PV, which currently has a capital cost of ≈ $1500/kW, and is expected to be ≈ $700/kW by 2050.

## Reliability

**Analysis of a modelled grid connected PV system with on site battery storage**

_What is reliability?_  
Reliability is defined as, "The ability of a system or device to carry out its desired function under predefined circumstances for a certain amount of time" by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. Power reliability is a more specific term that refers to an entire system's ability to deliver power to consumers with sufficient quantity, and compliance with specifications.

_Points of failure_  
The prevalence and recent advancements of battery energy storage technology increases the reliability and scalability of solar significantly. Conventional storage technologies such as pumped storage hydropower, or supplemental technologies such as wind, are required due to peak power generation occurring only when weather and time of day is optimal.

Despite its wide adoption, mostly due to its lower upfront cost compared to the aforementioned supplemental technologies, battery storage technology introduces a number of failure points due to its complex and decentralized nature. Batteries and battery management systems, inverters, and panels degrade over their lifespans due to factors such as temperature, humidity, and solar radiation. This is an issue because Solar PV is highly dependent on storage technologies.

Chongqing University in China aimed to investigate the power reliability of a large scale PV system by analyzing the expected rate of failure of these devices over time and factoring in response, diagnosis and repair timelines.

As the system continued to operate, the failure rate of individual components increased linearly. It is inferred that eventually every piece of equipment would need to be replaced.

Overall it was found that the system's power reliability was 80%, meaning **80% of the time, the system is expected to perform at its rated output.**

Average US Solar: 22–49 g CO2-eq./kWh — Avg: 46.5  
Average US Nuclear: 16–55 g CO2-eq./kWh — Avg: 43.5 — **NOT CONSIDERING AUSTRALIAN URANIUM CONCENTRATIONS**

- Therefore nuclear energy shows less g/CO2 per kWh
    
- However, this paper uses outdated information, assuming that panels are only ~12% efficient
    

### Life cycle emissions as CO₂ per unit of energy / Operation

#### Solar

First generation panels are currently the dominant technology due to their low cost and resilience. Within the first generation there are two dominant technologies: single crystal silicon (sc-Si), and multi crystal silicon (mc-Si)
