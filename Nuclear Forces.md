## What are nuclear forces?

### Electrostatic forces
Charged particles will move when force between them are not balanced. 

### Strong Nuclear Forces
To overcome the electrostatic repulsive forces between protons and keep the nucleus stable, strong nuclear forces are required. 

This is why protons and neutrons can come together in the nucleus despite their inert or repulsive electrostatic forces. In fact, **adding more neutrons will increase strong nuclear forces**, like how adding more mass will increase gravity. However, a*fter some time, there will be too many particles for a stable configuration to be achieved*.
#### Degradation of strong nuclear forces over distance
If you consider light, it decreases in intensity over distances using the inverse square law. 

Strong nuclear forces are extremely strong when particles are very close together, however increasing the distance slightly causes almost complete loss of force.
