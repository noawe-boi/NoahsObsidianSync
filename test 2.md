# Introduction

Lets set the scene. The year is 1989, New York city is the capital of racial violence, and 5 innocent boys aged 14 to 16
are in police custody for the alleged rape and attempted murder of a female jogger. Released in 2012, "The Central
Park Five", Directed by Sarah Burns, Ken Burns and David McMahon, and retells the story of these 5 boys and their
fight for justice and exoneration with a focus on how the media and its effect on society impacted their conviction.
'The Central Park Five' makes its view very clear from the start that the boys are innocent. Viewers are told and shown
that the boys are innocent, and from then, taken through the uphill battle that the accused fought not only against
the charges put against them, but against the racial stereotypes and injustice they face throughout their conviction. It
is stated and proven multiple times throughout the feature that the results of their trial were not determined by their
actions on the night that the crime took place. Jim Dwyer, a journalist that reported on the case while it was ongoing
claimed that "the truth and reality and justice were not a part of it", and that, in reality, the case was just a proxy war
fueled by the racial injustice that plagued the city of New York at the time.

In hindsight, this is obvious and the case is well regarded as one of the most well known examples of racial bias,
misarrange and overall failures of both the justice system, and the media's ability to remain unbiased and factual.
However, just because this statement is objectively true, doesn't mean everyone agrees with it.
