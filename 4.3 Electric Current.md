A flow of electric charge is called electric **currant**. Currant can be created by moving electrons in a wire of by ions in a solution

An electric circut is a path made of conductive material through which charges can flow in a closed loop. this flow is called electric currant.

### Conventional Flow 
A flow of 1C positive charge to the right in one second is the same as the same negative charge moving to the left in cone second. Both represent a conventional current of 1A to the right. 

Current is  measure of how fast electrons move through a point a point in a circut over time. 

![[current equation]]

where:
- I is the current in amps (A)
- q is the amount of charge in coloumns (C)
- n(e) is the number of electrons
- q(e) is the charge of an electron (-1.6x10^-19 C)
- t is the time in seconds (s)
