## Types of systems
### Open Systems/Steady State system
- Both matter and energy is exchanged
- Adding new material as the products are removed 
### Closed Systems
- Only energy is exchanged
- [[Dynamic Equilibrium]] only occurs in this system: i.e.
	- Reversable reactions must be carried out in closed systems in order to reach equilibrium. 

### Isolated systems
- No matter or energy is exchanged
- Irrelevant
