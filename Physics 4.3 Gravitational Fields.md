## Gravitational fields
![[Physics 4.3 Gravitational Fields 2025-02-26 09.05.26.excalidraw]]

### How gravitational fields relate to masses
All gravitational fields point towards the center of the mass

#### Remember
$$g=\frac{GM}{r^2}$$

Where:
- $g$ is the gravitational field strength
- $M$ is the mass of our first object
- $r^2$ is the radius between objects (center of first to center of second)
- $G$ is the gravitational constant
