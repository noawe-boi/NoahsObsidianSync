## What is a gravitational field?
A gravitational field is a region of space around a body or mass that causes other bodies to experience a force of gravitational attraction.

### How gravitational fields relate to masses
All gravitational fields point towards the center of the mass

#### Remember
$$g=\frac{GM}{r^2}$$

Where:
- $g$ is the gravitational field strength
- $M$ is the mass of our first object
- $r^2$ is the radius between objects (center of first to center of second)
- $G$ is the gravitational constant
