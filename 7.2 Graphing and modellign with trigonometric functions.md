### Foundational Concepts
#### The unit circle
![[The Unit Circle]]

- Sine $\rightarrow$ height
- Cosine $\rightarrow$ width
- Coterminal Angles

#### Transformations

![[Translations of quadratic diagram]]

### Big ideas and concepts
#### Parabola similarity
Just like parabolas, sine and cosine graphs can have transformations applied to them. 

These transformations are visually distinct in equations. 

### Vocab and definitions

#### Period
- Length of the circle
- "default" is $2\pi$ 

#### Amplitude
- Height from the median (or the middle)
- "default" is 1

#### Common sine and cos transformations
The graphs of $a\cdot\sin(b(x-c))+d$ and $a\cdot\cos(b(x-c))+d$
- Reflected about $x$ axis $\implies$ $a$ is negative. 
- Dilated by $|a|$ from $x$-axis (**amplitude**)
- Has a period of $\frac{2\pi}{b}$
	*or dilated by a factor or $\frac{1}{b}$ from $y$-axis
- Translated $c$ units **horizontally**
- Translated $d$ units ***vertically***
