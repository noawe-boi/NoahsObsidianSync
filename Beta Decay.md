### When does this occur
Â when there is unfavourable proton-to-neutron ratio


### What is ejected
A [[Beta Particle]]
![[Beta Particle]]
### Process of decay
#### Beta positive
- Takes a proton, turns it into a neutron and a [[Neutrino]], ejects electron and $V_e$.

#### Beta negative
- Takes a proton, turns it into a electron and an [[Antineutrino]], ejects electron particle and $\bar{V}_e$ 

### Effect of this
- Parent loses
	- One electron
