Denatured ethanol (98% ethanol) contains about 30% less energy than gasoline per gallon. Ethanol’s impact on fuel economy is dependent on the ethanol content in the fuel and whether an engine is optimized to run on gasoline or ethanol.\n\n\nhttps://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/ethanol-fuel-basics","x":3700,"y":904,"width":822,"height":460,"color":"5"},

The demand for fossil energy associated with biodiesel is\nlow, so its life cycle emissions of CO2 are, not surprisingly, much lower.
