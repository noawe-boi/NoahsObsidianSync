Aka Mechanical Work 

## 
### Definition
When [[Force]] is applied to an object and is actually moves

really just a measure of energy that actually gets put to use. not just wasted. 

### Formula
#### w = f x d where
- w = [[Work]] done in [[Joules]]
- f = [[Force]] in [[Newtons]]
- d = [[Distance]] travelled in meters. 



## Mechanical Work

### Definition 
The amount of energy given to or done by a system. 


delta x U = Q - W
Where, 
- delta U = The change in internal energy in [[Joules]]
- Q = the heat given to or lost by the system in [[Joules]](positive for heating and negative for cooling)
- W = Work in [[Joules]] (the work done to the system, W is positive. Work done by the system, W is negative)
