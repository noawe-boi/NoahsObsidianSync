### When [[Force]] is applied to an object and is actually moves
#### w = f x d where
- w = [[Work]] done in [[Joules]]
- f = [[Force]] in [[Newtons]]
- d = [[Distance]] travelled in meters. 
#### really just a measure of energy that actually gets put to use. not just wasted. 
#### example
###### if I push a car and it dont move i aint done [[Work]] but i still used energy.
