### Length
#### Real length $(L_0)$
The actual length, or the rest length

#### Relativistic length $(L)$
The length as observed, or the contracted length

### Length Contraction
As objects approach the speed of light, rather than exceed it, the object continues to travel at that its speed and the length that it travels appears shorter

$L=L_0\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$
