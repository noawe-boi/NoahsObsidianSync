### Length
#### Real length $(L_0)$
The actual length, or the rest length (observed by moving object)

#### Relativistic length $(L)$
The length as observed, or the contracted length (observed by observer)

### Length Contraction
As objects approach the speed of light, rather than exceed it, the object continues to travel at that its speed and the length that it travels appears shorter

$L=L_0\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$
### Perspective
$$v=\frac{L_0}{t}=\frac{L}{t_0}$$
From one perspective, length remains the same, however time dilates. 
From other perspective, length contracts but time stays the same

$L=\frac{L_0}{\gamma}=L_0\cdot\sqrt{1-\frac{c^2}{v^2}}$
